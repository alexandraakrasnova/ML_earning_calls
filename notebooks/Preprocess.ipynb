With me on the line today is Glenn Mattes, president and CEO of TFF; Kirk Coleman, chief financial officer; Dr. Dale Christensen, TFF's director of clinical development; Dr.\\nBill Williams of the University of Texas at Austin; and Chris Cano, TFF's chief operating officer. The press release announcing our second quarter results is available on the TFF Pharmaceuticals website. Please take a moment to read the disclaimer about forward-looking statements in the release. The earnings release and this teleconference both include forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made.\\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the disclaimer and in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Risk Factors section of our 2022 quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Mattes.\\nGo ahead, Glenn. \\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Corey. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review TFF's second quarter operations and recent highlights. During this call, I will provide an update on our overall financial progress, then ask our chief financial officer, Kirk Coleman, to review our second quarter financials. We appreciate all of the positive feedback from many of you on the format we used in our first quarter call.\\nSo we will take a similar approach today, Kirk and I will provide the formal commentary and then open up the call for questions to the entire team. Please note that we are joined by Bill Williams, Dale Christensen and Chris Cano, who will be available for the Q&A. The second quarter was another period of significant progress for the company. It is important to take a few minutes to focus on our Thin Film Freezing technology and how much we continue to learn about its potential.\\nAs we have discussed, TFF continues to increase the number of productive partnerships with pharma companies, academic institutions and the government. I am happy to say that the number of open material transfer agreements grew significantly in the second quarter, and we added three additional top 20 pharma companies through our portfolio of active collaborations. As we continue to advance these engagements beyond the initial formulation stage into advanced in vitro or animal testing, stability and production stages, the new data continues to support why we are so enthusiastic about the creation of shareholder value. There is absolutely no question that the growing demand for our technology reflects the versatility of Thin Film Freezing.\\nWe continue to successfully conduct numerous new feasibility studies across a broad range of experimental and approved drugs with an ever-increasing focus on biologics and complex macro molecules. These include monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins, mRNA, bacteriophages, siRNA, peptides and peptoids, in addition to small molecules and others. The work we're doing in the vaccine space is particularly exciting and continues to expand. You have no doubt seen the recent news about the need to develop vaccines that can be administered directly to the nasal mucosa and the lung.\\nI've always said that a major opportunity for the TFF technology is in the second- and third-generation vaccines. The TFF technology is uniquely positioned to enable this to happen. These vaccines are not limited to providing alternatives for COVID-19 vaccines. We are doing work in flu and many other types of infections, including viral, bacterial and fungal.\\nLet me take a few minutes to remind everyone about the specific advantages of Thin Film Freezing and why it is highly differentiated over other technologies. Dr. Bill Williams, co-inventor of Thin Film Freezing, recently published an article in BioPharm International titled, Improved Formulations to Enable Stable Delivery of Biologics. The article provides a concise summary explaining the unique advantages of Thin Film Freezing of our other dry powder technologies, including freeze drying processes, differences that largely account for our success in forging partnerships at every level of the industry, academia and government.\\nMany of these statements of work start with a comparison of Thin Film Freezing to other dry powder technologies. It's essential that a manufacturing process has not changed the molecular structure or properties of a drug, so this therapeutic activity is maintained, and that is particularly true in creating a dry powder formulation for biologics. As noted in Dr. Williams review article, conventional dry powder formulation techniques such as shelf freeze drying, spray freeze drying and spray drying are not well suitable for many biologics due to their tendency to result in the protein clumping into larger or inactive structures, a process that's known as aggregation.\\nIn addition, many biologics are quite fragile and cannot withstand the harsh impact of sheer and stress. Aggregation can negatively impact the activity of the biologic. By contrast, Thin Film Freezing results in particles, which are highly porous with a large surface area and low-density, attributes that help reduce the tendency toward aggregation and ensure optimal bioactivity of the molecule. In addition to avoiding aggregation, Thin Film Freezing also doesn't rely on elevated temperatures during the drying process.\\nThat is a stark contrast to other dry powder techniques such as spray drying, which require high temperatures in the drying process. This can lead to denaturation of the biologic and does negatively impact the molecules activity. The BioPharma article further notes Thin Film Freezing's applicability in developing novel vaccine formulations, including positive results with mRNA-based vaccines. Our work with materials and specific compounds supplied by our partners show that after withstanding repeated freezing and falling of a dry powder vaccine containing aluminum salts, the Thin Film Freezing vaccine does not show aggregation following a reconstitution.\\nImportantly, the formulation also maintains drug activity after high temperature storage with immunogenicity of the dry powder vaccine preserved to temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit. So if the approach to immunization for COVID-19 continues to produce vaccines reliant on cold chain distribution and storage, it is clear that by demonstrating these results, we believe that TFF Thin Film Freezing technology will enable manufacturers to overcome this significant hurdle. The other day, I read that COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers had to destroy over $1 billion worth of product, which underscores the need to solve cold chain supply challenges. At this point in the call, you may be wondering why I'm reviewing these new data.\\nMy purpose is to answer the many questions I get about what work we are doing with partners as we move toward finalizing agreements. And to help let you all know why we're so very optimistic about the positive direction of the business. A bit more new data before reviewing our business progress. As I touched on earlier, many of our partners are evaluating Thin Film Freezing to improve other vaccine formulations for powder delivery to the lung or nasal mucosa.\\nThese include those formulations containing the well-known MF59 adjuvant. By way of brief background, MF59 is a liposomal-based adjuvant that enhances the patient's immune response to a vaccine through localized upregulation of cytokines, chemokines and promoting the recruitment of venous immune cells. First approved back in 1997, MF59 is commonly used in pandemic or seasonal flu vaccines. It is generally recognized as having an excellent safety profile and is now licensed in more than 30 countries.\\nHowever, vaccines containing MF59 must be stored at refrigerated temperatures and are sensitive to accidental slow freeze conditions. Dr. Williams and his team at the University of Texas at Austin, just published another paper in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics, demonstrating that vaccines containing MF59 or AddaVax, which is a preclinical nanoemulsion that has the same composition and droplet size as MF59 can be converted to dry powder form by Thin Film Freezing. By contrast, the research showed that subjecting the same AddaVax composition, the shelf freeze drying led to significant aggregation or fusion of the droplets and the aggregation fusion was mainly due to the slow freezing required by conventional shelf freeze drying.\\nThin Film Freezing avoids this step and therefore, is much less likely to cause aggregation. Thin Film Freezing also continues to show significant potential for nasal delivery, which, again, will have significant relevance for the mandated future vaccine development. Intranasal vaccination using vaccine dry powders and attractive noninvasive modality with better storage stability and added protection at the mucosal services. Thin Film Freezing has proven viable in enabling the production of dry powders of a larger variety of vaccines, adjuvanted or not adjuvanted, protein-based or nucleic acid-based, for example, the mRNA vaccines and DNA vaccines, as well as live attenuated virus-based and the vaccine powders have desirable properties for intranasal administration.\\nOne last example, data from Dr. Williams Labs of a recent preclinical study in a rat model using partners material show that it is feasible to induce specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses following intranasal administration of a thin film freeze-dried vaccine candidate. The dry powder was prepared by Thin Film Freezing of a model antigen absorbed on aluminum oxy-hydroxide as an adjuvant. This further demonstrated the ability of the technology to work in a variety of adjuvanted vaccines.\\nSpecial emphasis was placed on the characterization of the dry powder vaccine formulation that can be realistically used in humans with an intranasal dry powder delivery device. The TFF vaccine powder was found to have good aerosol properties and the vaccine was uniformly distributed within the dry powder. An in vitro nasal deposition study using a 3D printed human nose model showed that around 90% of the vaccine powder was deposited in the nasal cavity. Intranasal immunization in animal studies with the TFF powder vaccine elicited a specific serum-antibody response, as well as a specific IgA response in the nose and lung secretions of the animals.\\nThus, intranasally administered dry powder made by Thin Film Freezing or vaccines has been confirmed. I repeat, it has been confirmed. Indeed, one additional publication from Dr. Williams Group and the TFF collaborators he worked with, recently received second place for the Best Paper Award 2022 by the Journal of Pharmaceutics.\\nIn this paper, our team described the formulation of remdesivir and an active analog. I will stop here and say that I can share additional successful data we are producing and working with our partners. Thanks to Bill Williams and the entire team. TFF Pharmaceuticals has become a key partner for pharma and biotech companies evaluating dry powder formulations.\\nBut our superior technology is only a starting point and a long line of value creation that ultimately leads to medicines with the potential to create significant clinical benefit and outcomes. For each one of our programs, we start with a singular purpose to enable more efficient, targeted delivery of medicine to the patient while minimizing systemic exposure. To accommodate growing demand for our technology, we recently opened a new R&D facility in Austin, Texas, which will provide us with significantly more lab space to develop larger scale production for our numerous partnered preclinical programs. Dr.\\nDonald Owens, our director of product development, will supervise the facility supported by Dr. John Koleng, TFF's vice president of product development and manufacturing. We're also expanding the product development team in Austin, which will be based at the new facility to support the growing number of partnered preclinical projects. Two additional points.\\nFirst, we continue to fully partner with all of our colleagues at the University of Texas. Second, we are taking a very efficient approach to funding the new lab space. The costs will be managed within our existing budgets. In addition, we do receive funds from our partners to fund many of the experiments that are part of the expanding material transfer agreements and statements of work.\\nNow, on to key business updates. First, our two most advanced clinical stage programs, Voriconazole Inhalation Powder and Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder, are currently in open label Phase 2 trials and we expect the initial valuable patient data by the end of the third quarter. As previously discussed, we intend to partner these programs and we're currently working with Torreya Partners to reach out broadly to potential interested companies. I'm happy to report that this process is going well with a number of companies under CDA and or in our product data rooms.\\nWe will release valuable patient data to those companies under CDA. Given each program's advanced stage of development, we seek partnerships that reflect our significant investment made to date and each product's potential to improve upon the current standard of care. In addition, we are working to build out the clinical supply materials so that prospective partners can remain focused on clinical development and registration strategy. We also expect both the VORI and TAC impact programs to gain more visibility in the very near term.\\nDr. Bradley Gardiner from the Royal Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, has been selected to provide a podium presentation on the ongoing compassionate use study of our Voriconazole Inhalation Powder at the International Congress on Lung transplantation, taking place in Paris, France on September 8 and 9. Notably, in this lung transplant patient, we observed the expected lack of drug-drug interactions when administering voriconazole by inhalation, thus the patient did not require dose adjustment of their tacrolimus immunosuppressant, which is not possible with oral voriconazole and demonstrates one of the safety advantages we expect to further demonstrate in our ongoing Phase II study. We remain very excited about the value these two programs are created for TFF and look forward to providing further updates.\\nLet me now provide an update on the status of inhaled niclosamide powder. I'm happy to tell you that we very recently sent the niclosamide Phase I complete study report to UNION. We believe this study report provides meaningful information to our partners at UNION as they continue to evaluate all of the data and assess TFF's Niclosamide Inhalation Powder. I can tell you that UNION is an outstanding partner and are quite impressed with the results.\\nThe UNION is working diligently to provide TFF with feedback on their option to license Niclosamide Inhalation Powder and begin a Phase II clinical program in COVID-19 patients. In other updates, our partnership with Catalent is progressing well. Catalent has referred a number of their clients to TFF to begin feasibility work. In addition, we are working with multiple Catalent sites preparing to install TFF equipment for the purpose of developing and manufacturing product candidates.\\nWe also continue to think strategically about the future of Augmenta 3387. TFF and Augmenta believe there is a therapeutic opportunity for an effective monoclonal antibody potentially in combination with other antiviral therapeutic options. TFF also continues to be increasingly encouraged about the potential for our inhaled cannabinoid product opportunities. We recently produced additional product to be used in further consumer testing.\\nThe opportunity to partner with TFF on these opportunities has now been presented to Glass House and a broader base of cannabis companies, both in the U.S. and Canada is our goal to determine a specific path forward shortly. As I said earlier, the number of pharma companies with open MTAs has increased, and we added three new top 20 companies during the second quarter. Our datasets are reaching critical decision inflection points with many partners.\\nOn the legislative front, we are keenly focused on the opportunity Thin Film Freezing offers to the advanced development of therapeutics and vaccines. TFF is working directly with members of the Congressional Appropriations Committee and departments within health and human services. We expect that opportunities will be considered for funding TFF efforts under the language written in the 2022 omnibus budget bill. In addition, as our development projects increase and mature, we now have been able to file funding grants, which help us advance programs already moving forward as a part of our two creatives and our academic partnerships.\\nFinally, the work we are progressing with DARPA formulating topical and ocular preparations of countermeasures is now in year two, and the preliminary results are promising and the feedback from Leidos is excellent. With those updates, I'd like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer, Kirk Coleman, for a review of our financials. Kirk?\\nKirk Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThank you, Glenn. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, research and development expenses for the company were $5.1 million compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2021. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022, for the company were $3.7 million compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2021. The company reported a net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2022, of $8.7 million compared to a net loss of $4.7 million for the same period in 2021.\\nWeighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted for the three months ended June 30, 2022, were 25,373,706 compared with 25,369,144 for the same period of 2021. As of June 30, 2022, we had total assets of approximately $27.9 million and working capital of approximately $21.4 million. At the end of the second quarter, our liquidity included approximately $20.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Glenn.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Kirk. The second half 2022 reported results promised to be a meaningful period for TFF Pharmaceuticals. I hope that I've given you a flavor for the data that further confirms the potential for our ubiquitous, unique and value-creating Thin Film Freezing platform technology. We are very well positioned to meet our needs, as well as the needs of our pharmaceutical, academic and government partners.\\nThe unmet needs of pharmaceutical development in this arena is perfectly set up for Thin Film Freezing. Please search out the comments by Dr. Fauci and other vaccine experts emphasizing the need to deliver vaccines directly to the nasal and lung mucosa. What a tremendous set of opportunities this is for TFF.\\nOur partnering activities continue to expand, we have in place both the personnel and facilities to accommodate this growth. As discussed, our inhaled voriconazole and tacrolimus programs are each slated to reach important clinical milestones, and we are also pleased with the pace of partnership discussions surrounding these two innovative products. Thanks to all of the TFF team for their hard work and positive outcomes and thanks, as always, to all of our investors. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open it up to questions.\\nOperator?\\nQuestions & Answers:\\nOperator\\nThank you. Before going into Q&A, Glenn Mattes has an additional piece of information to add.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Thank you. I want to take this opportunity to inform our listeners both on the live wire here and on the website that I'm announcing that in our 10-Q today, we did announce that, unfortunately, Malcolm Fairbairn has resigned from the TFF board. I certainly want to thank Malcolm for his counsel, his service and wish him well in his future endeavors.\\nAnd with that, now, we will open it up to questions. Thank you, operator.\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] The first question comes from Jonathan Aschoff with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nThank you. Thank you, guys. Glenn, since TFF continues to test CBD formulations with consumers, what are your thoughts about entering the market formally?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Jonathan, it's been a really interesting six months. We certainly again want to acknowledge that PLUS did a great job in helping us get ready formulation-wise, and we really have now been able to take those samples and test them with consumers and also introduce the technology to other companies. Glad, Glass House has not confirmed their interest at this point.\\nSo we have been working to go out to different companies. They've been working with our samples. They've been also testing it on some consumers. So we now have a real opportunity to sit back a little bit, look at a strategy of either one or multiple multistate operators to take this into the marketplace.\\nAnd we're hopeful that that can still happen later in the year. We also have seen an uptick in interest from companies since the vaping is very moved from tobacco. And I think a lot of the companies feel that there is a real opportunity to look at Thin Film Freezing cannabinoid formulations as a healthy alternative. Now, of course, that hasn't seated in yet to the CBD market.\\nBut I've noted and the folks I work with that are helping to sort of help me map this out a real uptake in interest. So hopefully, by the next quarter's update, I'll have some more specifics there. But we're really seeing terrific response to the product. And I think that's the key here in order for us to take a look at this being a positive contribution to our revenue lines.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nOK. And regarding the compassionate use case report for the lung -- that will be presented in Paris at that lung transplant congress. Do those results from that patient support the treatment hypothesis for IPA and give you confidence for success in the Phase II trial?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Dale, could you answer that question? You're closest to that data.\\nDale Christensen -- Director of Clinical Development\\nYes. Thanks, Glenn and thanks Jonathan. It's a very good question. As we stated previously, we believe that by delivering voriconazole by inhalation directly to the lung, we can increase the local concentration in the lung where you would derive the best therapeutic benefit, and we can also reduce the systemic concentration that's associated with the toxicity and drug-drug interactions from the oral voriconazole.\\nAnd the patient that we have been treating could not take oral voriconazole or any other azole antifungal due to toxicity and tolerability issues. One of the toxicities was that they had a history of melanoma and there's kind of a black box warning on voriconazole for melanoma. And so, this patient couldn't take it. And so, this patient was having declining lung function.\\nWhat we were able to do is stabilize the lung function due to effective treatment of the fungal infection, and we were able to do so without the patient having to adjust the dose of their tacrolimus immunosuppression medication. So it showed that we can have efficacy and without the drug-drug interactions. And so, it really does reinforce that treatment hypothesis that we've been working on.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nMy next question is, with the dominant BA.5 COVID variant and data on Paxlovid rebound cases, what do you think that creates in terms of an opening for niclosamide?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. Dale, can you answer that one as well, please?\\nDale Christensen -- Director of Clinical Development\\nSure. Thanks, again. Also, a very good question. So with the emergence of the BA.5 variant, it seems to be worse than the previous Omicron versions.\\nAnd really at 500 deaths a day -- nearly 500 deaths a day in the U.S. And basically, worldwide 65 deaths around the world from COVID in the last four weeks. It very clearly indicates COVID is not over and better treatments are needed. And so, that level of death really isn't acceptable.\\nAnd many of the patients that die are in high-risk categories, cancer patients, patients who can't take Paxlovid due to drug-drug interactions. And we think that those patients will benefit from inhaled niclosamide because they're -- again, like fluconazole, when we deliver to the lung, you can avoid drug-drug interactions. And we've also seen that from the Paxlovid rebound, it's very clear that BA.5 and potentially future variants will take longer. And so, we're planning to -- when we move forward dose longer in our studies because we can avoid the drug-drug interactions that have great safety, we think that we can prevent the rebound and we'll monitor that during the clinical trials.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nAnd sorry to hog the mic, but two more. Should partnering of VORI and TAC happen, will you bring in new internal development programs and how will you select them? And the last question is, you added three top 20 pharmas. What's that bring the total number to?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nOK. So yes, our goal is always to have an active internal set of products that we're developing. We're not turning into a company that is going to take these things all the way to the finish line. But the goal is to -- just like we're doing with VORI and TAC, take them through meaningful clinical inflection points.\\nThe 505(b)(2) strategy certainly was the right way for us to go. But strategically, we're looking at potential arrangements that would include co-development and sharing of development like we did with Augmenta where we split development 50-50. Augmenta, we were going to take through Phase I and still naive and then split proceeds from that point on. So we have a number of different options available to us as we seek to -- we kind to refresh and serially look at taking products to the pipeline.\\nIn general, Jonathan, it takes about $7 million to $12 million depending on the cost of the API to get us to that inflection point. So we have some products that we've been -- and compounds we've been looking at. Jordan Kennedy, who's our lead analyst has been working with some folks on the outside to do some analysis on what the market opportunities might be and what the development programs might look like. So as soon as we created revenue and cleared out the expense for VORI and TAC, we will look to refresh that internal portfolio.\\nOn the top 20 question, I don't remember the exact number. We were at a majority. So we're somewhere now in the area of -- we'll come back to you on the exact number, I would say, between 12 and 15, probably on the higher side of that. But the good news there is, those companies, many of them are not one-trick ponies.\\nWe have multiple projects that we're working with them. And those programs are getting -- are quite detailed, some of them in the very last stages of producing data and others that are at the starting gate. And we're really excited about and wish we -- frankly, we wish we could share some of these with you. The big companies are very hesitant to let us disclose and you -- if you knew what we were working on, you can understand the competitive nature of what Thin Film Freezing could be doing for those companies and their compounds in their marketplaces.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nOK. Do you still see the VORI and TAC trials as pivotal? Or is that authentic?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, we certainly feel that the data will be meaningful. And Jonathan, you know that the FDA never says yes, and they never say no, it depends on the data. When we talk to the partner companies that we're already under CDA with and that are in the data room, we certainly talk about what potentially those latter -- those additional studies might look like. And believe me, as you know, those partners will be looking at those as well.\\nBut we'll start to see it pretty soon on what those data are showing us. And hopefully, we believe certainly that those data will be quite good, and we'll see where that lands us.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nThank you very much, guys.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nBut one thing to note, Jonathan, we have not budgeted for additional trials. So the assumption here is that, the partner would take those -- if those trials needed to be done, would do those trials.\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nUnderstood. Thank you.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Jonathan.\\nOperator\\nThe next question comes from Daniel Carlson with TW Research Group. Please go ahead.\\nDaniel Carlson -- TW Research Group -- Analyst\\nHey, Glenn. Thanks for taking the questions. First off, you're making great progress it appears and bringing in MTAs and potential partners there. But we're still looking at preclinical stuff.\\nAnd in the past, you've mentioned some pretty large numbers associated with getting these partners into full license agreement. So I'm just wondering, what is the big hurdle in getting from preclinical to in-human trials? And is it the terms or are they too tough? Or just trying to figure that one out?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nNo, the terms are not an issue, Daniel. When we engage with a company, Chris is very clear what the expectations are and what the relationship would look like. So in discussions that we've had with companies that are closer to the finish line and terms are discussed, certainly, there's some negotiation there. But that -- we don't see that as a rate limiting step.\\nAnd we're -- that's really the bottom line. We're maturing the data before any company is willing to write a check and license it. They want to be sure that we've answered all their clinical questions, and that's where we're at. And sometimes it moves a little bit slower than we want, but the data are being seen in a very positive light.\\nAnd we don't see the financials as being an obstacle.\\nDaniel Carlson -- TW Research Group -- Analyst\\nGot you. That's good news then. The next question I have is like once again, in the past, you've mentioned that you've never lost a bake up, and I'm sure that a lot of these companies are looking at everything out there. And certainly, there has been a lot of stuff in the press about other people trying nasal vaccines, etc.\\nSo I'm just wondering, is it still the case that every one of the companies you're talking to has not moved forward with alternative technologies and do you guys are still in the running?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nI can't say that they know of any company that informed us that they've moved forward with an alternative technology. There have been a few companies that have decided to stick with the base program before moving on to Thin Film Freezing. We've seen a little bit of an uptick in that, Daniel, in full transparency in these tough times in the capital markets where if things were better, I think these are the smaller- to medium-sized companies. They go into the capital markets to raise funding to do the project.\\nSo for a few of them we're on hold. But it's become pretty routine and it's almost predictable. Chris and I sit on these calls, you know they're comparing us to the standard lyophilization approaches. And that's why, frankly, I have Bill to do -- provide me with some of the specific data from his trials and publications to reassure the investor that we continue to produce outstanding data better than what you can see with the alternative modalities.\\nAnd that's now even going beyond, we will or even like three to six months ago looking at nasal delivery or a Dale is doing on the DARPA program. So that was a little bit of a different approach today, but those four papers that I cited and there are others where we're actually using partners' materials, I think give great evidence to that.\\nDaniel Carlson -- TW Research Group -- Analyst\\nYes. I was going to ask you about the papers that you published and just what they mean for your commercialization efforts.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nBill, do you have a perspective on that?\\nBill Williams -- Scientific Consultant\\nI do. Yes. That's a great question. So our strategy has always been to -- and you can follow our papers is, we are -- our papers are the way that we teach our partners and potential partners about our technology and about potential uses that they can imagine with their compounds that they're working on, they can imagine it in our technology.\\nAnd so, we look for problems. We look for -- we're very aggressive in studying competing technologies and finding holes in competing technologies where our Thin Film Freezing sits in, and then our papers are a way that we leverage that with partners and potential partners. So it's a critical part of commercialization. And one last thing is, when we have our calls that Chris Cano and others set up, I mean, we're talking with the company's top scientists and they're all science-driven at the point we're talking to them.\\nAnd so, they want to see our data, they want to see it in publications and also publishing like this, it's a key part for our -- for the company.\\nDaniel Carlson -- TW Research Group -- Analyst\\nGot you. And then, Glenn, one last question for me. It looks like -- I think you put some new logos in your slide deck, and you've got three new MTAs or top 20, you mentioned. How does it -- is there a criteria for getting in there, you hitting a certain level of relationship? Or why are some companies in there and others not?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. So Daniel, we certainly don't even approach the subject until we think we have on a meaningful path. The bigger companies are really, really reluctant to do that. We've had some breakthroughs there.\\nI think those are symbolic of sort of where we're at in terms of the work we're doing with them. We don't fight too hard as they say, no, look, we don't want to do anything to upset the Apple cards here. But when it's appropriate and when we think it's at a reasonable time, we will ask and -- but don't take it that if the logo isn't on there, it doesn't mean that we're in a pretty good place in terms of where we are in working with those companies. So it's -- we started that as a practice of where we can, putting companies or academic institutions on the slide.\\nWe'll continue to look for opportunities to do that. It just as an indication that we're moving forward. And in this quarter, I wish I can tell you who we signed up with and have new MTAs with, very exciting. But again, realize those three are starting from the starting line, and it won't happen in the next quarter, but hopefully soon enough.\\nDaniel Carlson -- TW Research Group -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Looking forward to second half here. A lot of exciting stuff coming.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you. Operator, do we have any more questions?\\nOperator\\nWe do. The next question comes from Michael Okunewitch with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nVery good. Thank you.\\nMichael Okunewitch -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. So, I guess, my first question, I'd like to think a bit big picture and just see, given that you've had a lot more partner interaction in particular on the big pharma side, if you could talk about what kind of feedback you're getting on what specifically attracted them to the TFF platform as opposed to other inhalable technologies?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nGood question. Chris, you probably have more of the initial calls. Can you answer that question, please?\\nChris Cano -- Chief Operating Officer\\nYes, sure. Thanks, Michael, for the question. So when we're dealing with a big pharma company, right, and engaging with them in discussions, there's usually a product that's been identified, usually a biologic that has a challenge. And so, we -- before we even engage with that partner, we do some diligence, we look at their pipeline and then we come to them with a solution to their problem.\\nAnd so, whether it is right for inhalation, whether it is for cold chain, now we're even exploring, as we've talked about, intranasal, it really depends on what the partners' program, what their challenge is, and that's where we really focus our efforts because our dry powder offers the solution to their problem.\\nMichael Okunewitch -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\\nYes, very much so. And then, just as a follow-up, in terms of that collaboration activity, I'd like to just ask where you see the partners looking to apply the technology. Is this -- are you more looking at reformulations of drugs that are already approved in life cycle management and just improving the profile of their existing products? Or is it more so novel drugs in their pipeline that would work better once you apply the tech?\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. So it's a good question. So when I started here almost five years ago and I recruited Chris, that come in shortly after. If you would ask this then, this question, I certainly would have said it would be more reformulation.\\nAnd -- but now as we sit here today, I'm going to -- I don't have an exact pie chart in front of me. I'd say it's about 80% NCEs and biologics and about 20% to 25% reformulation. Chris, you can -- if I'm way off, you can correct me, but I think that's a fair assessment of where we're at. It's come out much differently than I originally thought.\\nWe started to reach out to different kinds of companies when we started this. And then, slowly as we began to introduce the technology to companies as well, this is where this whole biologics set of opportunities really exploded for us. And what's unique about that, too, Michael is, we have seen some situations where we've gone as far as successfully formulating, getting into animals and then that new chemical entity isn't quite what the partner wants to see in terms of the outcome. And they'll give us another set of materials in a biologics space.\\nSo you do like it's kind of out of our hands there because we've done everything we need to do from a technology standpoint. And sometimes, it's come down to, wait a minute, their compound didn't really produce the kind of results that they needed. So it takes you back. They don't walk away from us, but it takes you back to the starting line again.\\nMichael Okunewitch -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\\nThank you. And I really appreciate the additional color and congrats in the progress over the quarter.\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Michael. It's really -- again, I wish as I sit here today, I could tell you who these top 20s are and what we're working on because it's incredibly exciting. So I see that I think we have exhausted the list of questioners, and we're about at the end of the hour. I want to thank all of you for listening.\\nI want to hope -- I wish you all an enjoyable rest of the summer, and stay healthy. And we really do look forward to ongoing discussions with you. And before or if not, at least at the time we report our third quarter results. Thank you very much.\\nOperator\\n[Operator signoff]\\nDuration: 0 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nCorey Davis -- Investor Relations\\nGlenn Mattes -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\nKirk Coleman -- Chief Financial Officer\\nJonathan Aschoff -- ROTH Capital Partners -- Analyst\\nDale Christensen -- Director of Clinical Development\\nDaniel Carlson -- TW Research Group -- Analyst\\nBill Williams -- Scientific Consultant\\nMichael Okunewitch -- Maxim Group -- Analyst\\nChris Cano -- Chief Operating Officer\\nMore TFFP analysis\\nAll earnings call transcripts\",\n          \"Prepared Remarks:\\nOperator\\nGood day, and welcome to the VMware Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Ziots, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to VMware's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Raghu Raghuram, Chief Executive Officer; and Zane Rowe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions.\\nOur press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Slides which accompany this webcast can be viewed in conjunction with live remarks and downloaded at the conclusion of the webcast from ir.vmware.com.\\nOn this call today, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors described in the 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks VMware files with the SEC. We assume no obligation to and do not currently intend to update any such forward-looking statements.\\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of VMware's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on our GAAP results of stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax and employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, realignment charges, acquisition, disposition, certain litigation matters and other items, as well as discrete items impacting our GAAP tax rate. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures, in the press release and on our Investor Relations website.\\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 60 days on our Company website under the Investor Relations link. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 quiet period begins at the close of business, Thursday, January 13, 2022.\\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Raghu.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Paul. I am pleased with the continued strong performance in Q3 fiscal year 2022 with revenue of $3.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $1.72 per diluted share. Earlier this month, we successfully completed our spin-off from Dell Technologies. As a stand-alone Company, we have more strategic and financial flexibility to deliver on our multi-cloud strategy. We are also able to partner even more deeply with all the cloud and on-premise infrastructure companies to create a better foundation that drives results for our customers.\\nCustomers continue to choose VMware as their trusted digital foundation to accelerate their innovation, and we continue to expand and advance our portfolio to meet their needs in these three ways: one, deliver a cloud-native app platform for building modern applications in a public cloud-first world; two, migrate enterprise applications to a cloud-agnostic infrastructure; and three, build out the secure edge to optimize across our workspace and edge-native applications. These three focus areas are built on a horizontal set of offerings across networking, security and management. It's clear that multi-cloud will be the model for digital business for the next 20 years and in this vibrant dynamic marketplace, the pace of innovation is relentless. VMware is at the center of it.\\nIn the modern app space, we recently provided the Department of Education for one of America's largest cities with application resiliency as part of their business continuity project. Leveraging VMware Tanzu, the customer now has improved ability to respond to ever-changing needs of students, their families and faculty while protecting student information and creating an environment to accelerate their innovation and automation. One of our new beta offerings in the space is the Tanzu Application Platform, which will make it easier and simpler for developers to drive productivity and velocity in a more secure fashion on any cloud. Our Tanzu portfolio is now one of the most comprehensive in the industry for both Kubernetes operations and developer experience. We also recently unveiled Tanzu Community Edition, a freely available, easy-to-manage Kubernetes platform for learners and users, and Tanzu Mission Control Starter, a multi-cloud, multi-cluster Kubernetes management solution available as a SaaS service.\\nWe are pleased to share some customer stories in support of our VMware Cloud services across the hyperscalers. PennyMac, a leading financial services firm is leveraging VMware Horizon on VMware Cloud on AWS to provide loan officers and call center agents a more secure work-from-anywhere virtual desktop in a fully automated and scalable cloud environment. We also worked with the University of Miami, who looked to the Azure VMware solution to support their VMware workloads on their preferred public cloud provider.\\nRecently, we announced new advancements for VMware Cloud, the industry's first and only cloud-agnostic computing infrastructure. Newly unveiled Project Arctic will bring the power of cloud to customers running VMware vSphere on-premises. It will enable cloud-based management for hundreds of thousands of vSphere customers and vSphere deployments around the world. Customers will be able to benefit from life cycle management, cloud disaster recovery and cloud burst capabilities as an extension of their vSphere deployments. We will bring Project Arctic to market next year as the next step in making our portfolio available in a subscription and SaaS form factor.\\nWe also announced VMware Sovereign Cloud initiative, where we are partnering across our VMware Cloud providers to deliver cloud services on a sovereign digital infrastructure to customers in regulated industries.\\nLastly, we introduced a tech preview of an exciting new management technology, Project Ensemble. It is designed to manage apps across multiple public clouds, bringing together a comprehensive set of costs, security, automation and performance capabilities for the public cloud environment.\\nVMware was once again ranked number one in the September 2021 IDC report titled Worldwide Cloud System and Service Management Software Market Shares, 2020: Growth Continues for the Top Vendors. In the area of Edge, we recently helped an international wholesaler with 800 stores across 30 countries to refresh its decade-old in-store platform. The VMware Edge Compute Stack is now serving as a single platform for both the customers existing and modern applications, offering a right-sized resilient solution that is providing ROI for their business. As a continued commitment to helping our customers at the Edge, we recently introduced VMware Edge, a product portfolio that will enable organizations to run, manage and better secure edge-native applications across multiple clouds anywhere. Together, VMware Cloud, Tanzu, VMware Edge and Anywhere Workspace offer our customers a solution for all of their applications across their multi-cloud environment.\\nIn the security space, VMware is delivering solutions built specifically for threats customers face today. We use the power of software, combined with a scaled-out distributed architecture, zero trust design principles and a cloud delivery model for better security that's easier to use. We are excited about our continuing innovation in SASE, Secure Access Services Edge, especially as many businesses are now working as a distributed workforce. We also announced the industry's first elastic application security edge, which enables the networking and security infrastructure at the data center or cloud edge to flex and adjust as app traffic changes. In the third quarter, VMware was positioned as a leader in The Forrester New Wave: Zero Trust Network Access Q3 2021.\\nOn the telco front, Vodafone recently selected VMware to deliver a single platform to automate and orchestrate all workloads running on its core networks across Europe, starting with 5G stand-alone. This recent work builds on Vodafone's previous selection of VMware Telco Cloud Infrastructure as its network functions virtualization platform.\\nIn the third quarter, VMware received additional recognition from leading industry analyst firms, once again being named as a leader in the August 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Unified Endpoint Management Tools. Additionally, VMware was once again named a leader in the September 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure. Our innovation engine is thriving as we bought many of these new offerings, features, beta programs and partnerships to the forefront during VMworld 2021, which attracted approximately 116,000 registrants. We look forward to hosting VMworld China and VMworld Japan in the coming weeks.\\nOur environmental, social and governance agenda continues to be very important to us and core to our culture. VMware received recognition for our ESG leadership by being included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, one of the world's leading ESG benchmarks for the second consecutive year.\\nIn summary, we strive to serve our customers in three unique ways: by being the trusted foundation for their most critical business operations; by offering a best-of-breed, innovative portfolio of best-in-class solutions to fulfill their multi-cloud vision; and by having a broad set of strategic partnerships required to unlock the full potential of multi-cloud.\\nI'll now turn it over to Zane for more detail on our business performance, as well as our forecast.\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nThank you, Raghu. We are pleased with our Q3 financial performance, which exceeded our initial expectations and is a continuation of the good performance we've seen all year. We saw solid demand in the quarter and continued to execute on our multi-cloud strategy.\\nTotal revenue for Q3 was $3.2 billion. Combined subscription and SaaS and license revenue grew 16% year-over-year totaling $1.5 billion, ahead of our guidance. Subscription and SaaS revenue of $820 million was up 21% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, representing 26% of total revenue for the quarter. Subscription and SaaS ARR was $3.3 billion, up 25% year-over-year in Q3. Our largest contributors to subscription and SaaS were VCPP, Tanzu, EUC, Carbon Black and VMware Cloud on AWS, which saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue and ARR. License revenue in Q3 grew 11% year-over-year to $710 million. The strength we saw was due to good execution in the quarter and our broad installed base of customers that see us as the trusted ally for their mission-critical workloads. Our strategy is resonating with our customers who are confident that their investments can be leveraged over the longer-term in multi-cloud environments.\\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the quarter of $935 million was driven by our revenue performance and lower-than-expected growth in expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 29.3% with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.72 on a share count of 422 million diluted shares.\\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in unearned revenue and $12.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which includes proceeds from our $6 billion bond issuance. The bond issuance proceeds together with $4 billion of additional borrowings from term loan commitments, as well as other available cash on hand was used to fund a special dividend of $11.5 billion. The special dividend was paid on November 1 to all stockholders of record on October 29 in conjunction with our spin-off from Dell Technologies.\\nQ3 cash flow from operations was $1,090 million and free cash flow was $984 million. RPO was $11.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and current RPO was $6.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Total backlog was $124 million, substantially all of which consisted of orders received on the last three days of the quarter that were not shipped and orders held due to our export control process. License backlog at quarter end was $34 million.\\nWe are pleased with the overall bookings performance in Q3 as we continue to scale our subscription and SaaS offerings. We saw strong year-over-year product bookings growth in major product categories. Core SDDC product bookings increased over 20% year-over-year. Compute was up low-double digits, and Cloud Management was up strong double digits year-over-year. Both of these were helped by our multi-cloud subscription and SaaS offerings. We saw momentum in VMware Cloud, which includes hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Oracle. We also continue to drive innovation in new product offerings across our Carbon Black Cloud and Tanzu platforms.\\nNSX increased in the low double digits versus Q3 last year, and vSAN grew in the high-teens year-over-year. EUC product bookings, as well as sub and SaaS ACV bookings were up in the strong double digits year-over-year.\\nIn Q3, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares in the open market at an average price of $150 per share. In early October, our Board of Directors authorized up to $2 billion of stock repurchases through FY'24, which replaced the relatively small balance remaining on our prior authorization.\\nAs a part of our capital allocation framework, we plan to use our cash generation and balance sheet to invest in growing our business both organically and inorganically, paying down debt and returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, we are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and rating.\\nTurning to guidance for fiscal 2022. We're increasing our expectation for total revenue to $12,830 million, a growth rate of approximately 9% year-over-year. We expect the combination of subscription and SaaS and license revenue to total $6,305 million, an increase of approximately 12% year-over-year. Approximately 50.5% of this amount is expected to be subscription and SaaS.\\nWe are increasing guidance for non-GAAP operating margin for the full-year to 30% and non-GAAP earnings per share to $7.19 on a diluted share count of 422 million shares. We're also increasing our cash flow from operations guidance to $4.1 billion and increasing free cash flow expectations to $3.7 billion. This reflects our performance in Q3 combined with our outlook for FY'22.\\nFor Q4, we expect total revenue of $3,510 million or a growth rate of approximately 7% year-over-year. We expect $1,875 million from subscription and SaaS and license revenue in Q4 or an increase of nearly 9% year-over-year with approximately $860 million from subscription and SaaS, reflecting the current pace of adoption of our subscription and SaaS offerings.\\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 30.4% for Q4 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 on a diluted share count of 422 million shares. Additional guidance details for Q4 and FY'22 are contained in the slide deck accompanying this call.\\nWe typically provide some color on our upcoming fiscal year at this time. We are driving innovation across the portfolio, scaling our subscription and SaaS offerings and progressively making our products available as subscription and SaaS. Consistent with the outlook framework we presented at the Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we currently expect total FY'23 revenue to grow in the high-single digits while we continue to build out our subscription and SaaS portfolio. We are planning on growing our sub and SaaS revenue to nearly 30% of total revenue with our FY'23 exiting ARR growth rate exceeding FY'22's. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28%, which is similar to our initial outlook for FY'22, reflecting continued investments in subscription and SaaS and the resumption of more normalized level of T&E as we support our customers.\\nIn closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making on our multi-cloud strategy as reflected in our performance this quarter and in our outlook for FY'22 and FY'23. As a stand-alone Company, we are well positioned to enable our customers' multi-cloud journey and become the multi-cloud leader.\\nI'll now turn it back to Paul for Q&A.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Zane. Before we begin the Q&A, I'll ask you to limit yourselves to one question consisting of one part so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator, let's get started.\\nQuestions and Answers:\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nMatthew Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nHey, guys. Thanks. Great. Perhaps [Phonetic] congrats on the results and completing the spin first of all. I don't know, maybe Zane for you. License revenue was a bit better than we thought. You sort of talked about that in your script, but subscription and SaaS was maybe a little lighter, just a tad lighter than we thought. I'm wondering, could you help us with a little bit more color on what drove that mix. And as we think about subscription and SaaS trends accelerating into fiscal 2023, are there things that you guys are doing, like sales incentives or partner incentives to drive subscription and SaaS?\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nYeah. Matt, thanks for the question. And I'll start and then, obviously, happy to hand over to Raghu to talk a little bit more about where we are looking into Q4, as well as next year. First off, I'd say, this was well within the framework that we discussed at the analyst meeting last month. So we're really pleased with the outperformance that we saw for the whole Company in Q3. As you highlighted, license came in much stronger. We had a number of deals over $10 million that exceeded our expectation in the quarter.\\nAnd our sub and SaaS performance came in, in line. So we're actually pleased with the increase that we've seen there. We had, as I mentioned, a nice healthy increase on a year-over-year basis, ARR 25% year-over-year. So everything was going according to plan for both the third quarter and the full-year as it relates to the sub and SaaS. We just continue to develop those products. We've highlighted the improvements and increases we've made in some of those segments that Raghu will get into. But generally, we're pleased. We're seeing some of the same trends that we highlighted in Q3, along the term of where we see the license in some of our products like Horizon, where customers are choosing the term license versus some of the sub and SaaS offerings, but nothing different from the trend that we saw in Q3 and our expectations heading into next year.\\nMaybe, Raghu, if you want to touch on how we think about the product development over the course of Q4?\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, definitely. We are very excited about the product portfolio as it is laying out for us. So, as we have talked before that we look at our product portfolio on the SaaS and subscription side in three buckets. One is the pure SaaS and subscription offerings, 100% SaaS and subscription. We expect them to start to reach scale and start to impact our growth even in a much bigger fashion.\\nSecondly, we have a set of products that we call customer choice, basically meaning the customers can choose to get them in a perpetual or a term license form factor or in a subscription form factor. And this includes products like our Cloud Management, which are growing really well for us.\\nAnd then thirdly, products today that are primarily licensed, our core SDDC offerings that we'll be progressively making available as a subscription and SaaS next year. And we announced the first of those with the Project Arctic, and we believe they will start to contribute in the coming years as well. So the combination of these three will drive the product portfolio even more to subscription and SaaS and drive its growth.\\nAnd then last but not the least, we'll be tailoring our go-to-market programs, including our sales place and incentives and so on and so forth to drive all of these product shifts.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Matt. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan.\\nMark Murphy -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\\nYes. Thank you. And I will add my congrats on a very nice performance. Raghu and Zane, so we've shown that your partner ecosystem is clearly positive and upbeat regarding the spin-off from Dell. I'm wondering, how is that excitement manifesting at this stage? And understanding it's very early stage, but can you sense partners perhaps mobilizing to staff up or bulk up on VMware-certified personnel? Maybe they're planning to lean in on co-marketing, co-selling next fiscal year. Just curious if there's any leading indicators that give you a sense of a tailwind that might be developing sometime during next fiscal year.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So, as you pointed out, it's pretty early. We're still in month one of the spin and being a stand-alone Company. Having said that, a lot of what you have said is exactly what we are seeing from the partners. We are seeing a sense of excitement and possibility from the partners. There are partners that are already planning to or starting to staff up on their VMware expertise. We are talking to other partners about what we could do to help them further in the markets where we could have joint solutions. So all these conversations have started happening, and these all have different timeline depending upon whether they are purely go-to-market or they involve technical collaboration and joint solutions, etc., etc. So I do expect that you will start to see some results over the course of the next year. Like I tell our internal employees, day one for us post-spin may not look very different, but day 365, you'll certainly start to see the benefits of it. And so, that's where we are.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Mark. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\\nRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHey. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats from me as well. Can I go back to Matt's question a little bit in terms of pragmatics? As you talk with your clients, but as you also think about the sales and incentives, the change in incentives next year a little bit, what do you see in terms of clients' understanding appreciation of your subscription, SaaS offering versus taking the choice around more of the license part? Because that's the one thing that everyone is focusing on, and it feels like you don't getting as much credit for the license part. So where are clients is coming out of the pandemic kind of their focus more to do more license again? Or how do we have to think about it? How can you influence that as well? Thank you.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Thanks, Raimo. I'll start and then Sumit can add additional color as well. So, what I would say from our customers' point of view, it depends on a couple of factors. One is the product category that we are talking about. For example, if you think about Cloud Management, there is definite decided industry shift toward consuming management as a SaaS service. So we are seeing -- that's part of the reason why we are seeing our SaaS offerings and subscription offerings for management grow very nicely.\\nIf you think about our core universal offering, which is for the infrastructure, that is designed to help customers on their journey to the cloud. So very often, they are starting on-premise with licensed software. And then over a period of time, they intend to shift to the cloud. And then in terms of the third big bucket, which is the end-user computing, it depends on the customer segment.\\nAnd let me give it over to Sumit to add more color.\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nYeah. Hi, Raimo. How are you? First of all, I would say....\\nRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nHey, Sumit.\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nHey. First of all, I would say that Q3 in addition to the results that Zane and Raghu talked about was a great quarter for us in terms of engaging with customers through our VMworld event, introducing all of our new offerings. And the momentum on that front with customer front is great because it's clear for customers as they're looking at their own strategies for cloud and multi-cloud, VMware becomes their key partner going forward. And on that, many of their -- how they build their multi-cloud control plane, whether it's through our Cloud Management software, Tanzu solutions, as well as cloud infrastructure to be served from multi-cloud, VMware gives them the right platform to do so.\\nSo, now to arrive at that solution, our universal programs gives them the best choice and flexibility to adopt subscription and SaaS and adopt cloud at their own pace. And we are continuing to see very, very strong interest and pull from customers and going toward multi-cloud using our universal offers, where they can start adopting our cloud solutions gradually as they're ready and they're not sort of having to spend double costs, if you may, where they have to run both on-premise and cloud and double pay. They can just transition to the cloud solutions and our subscription, SaaS offerings using our universal offers at their own pace and speed.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Raimo.\\nRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nNext question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\\nMark Moerdler -- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. -- Analyst\\nThank you very much, and congrats on both the spin-out in the quarter. As we've discussed before, VMware is using term licenses as a bridge to the cloud, but you're not including that revenue in subscription or SaaS. So, can -- to help us better understand the impact, can you give us some breakdown of how much of the revenue we're seeing in the quarter is from license and maintenance is coming from those term licenses that could convert over to subscription and SaaS? Thank you.\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nYeah. Mark, I'm happy to start with that. As you alluded to, we see the term licenses, in particular with our Horizon offering to be that step for many, if not, all of our customers to sub and SaaS. So we're very pleased with the performance we've seen there in offering our customers flexibility and allowing them with that transition. If you were to think about quantifying the term license amount, it's roughly 13.5% of our license for the quarter. So it's just under $100 million in total that is sort of qualified as term. And as you point out, unlike a number of others, we included in our license bucket. We don't necessarily expect this to increase significantly over the years, at least as we've outlined our strategy today. So we think it will moderate around this number. And then ultimately, as we highlighted in many, if not, all of our products, will rotate to more sub and SaaS. And we see this as a natural step for our customers in their sub and SaaS journey as well.\\nHopefully, that adds some color for you, Mark.\\nMark Moerdler -- Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. -- Analyst\\nYes, it does. And I really do appreciate. Thank you very much and have a happy, healthy Thanksgiving and holidays to everyone.\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nOf course, thank you. You too.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Mark. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\\nPhilip Winslow -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\nHi. Thanks guys for taking my question, and congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to focus in on core vSphere and in particular, vSphere 7 with Tanzu. Obviously, with that release, vSphere 7, you had a native support within vSphere of Kubernetes and containers. Kind of two questions here together. Could you give us sort of an update of adoption of vSphere 7 with Tanzu? And what are you hearing from customers about why they're using VMware?\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So I'll start and Sumit, perhaps you can add more. Yeah. So vSphere 7 has been in the market for a while, and we have seen very successful adoption of it. And besides the customers moving to the latest and greatest, the ability to run containers through Tanzu is a key reason why they adopt it. What we are seeing on-premise especially, is that, as customers tend to build out their private cloud and make it as compelling as a public cloud in terms of developer agility and so on and so forth, containers become a necessary part of the core infrastructure platform offering or Infrastructure-as-a-Code offering. So that's what we are seeing happen with our customers. So -- and a lot of the workloads that traditionally were running on VMs that are these mission-critical workloads are now being converted into containers and run on vSphere.\\nThe other thing that you might have noticed as we published on our benchmark sites as well is that, customers are finding they can get 6 times the density of running containers on vSphere as compared to running it on bare metal using alternative products. So not only the manageability benefits are appealing to them, because we are now supporting containers natively on vSphere 7, you're getting a tremendous density benefit, which obviously results in significant cost savings as well. So these are some of the reasons why customers are excited about it.\\nAnd in terms of some customer adoption patterns, let me hand it over to Sumit.\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nYeah. Hey, Phil. Customers as they're looking at Kubernetes, first of all, high interest and containers high interest, but they're in the journey of kind of early innings of expanding the adoption. And they're excited about using vSphere 7 as this platform where they can manage both VMs and containers holistically. So, I would say, from a customer adoption perspective, huge interest, still early stage. But vSphere 7 adoption and how customers are using those two technologies, both containers and VMs together, really good.\\nIn addition, we introduced Tanzu Community Edition at VMworld, which also complements really well our entire stack and works also with customers wanting to use Tanzu full-stack solution with public cloud Kubernetes distribution. And the adoption of our Tanzu Kubernetes Edition that we introduced at VMworld has been stellar over the course of last six to eight weeks. So I'd say customer adoption, even though early stage, tons of interest in both vSphere 7, as well as Tanzu Community Edition, which gives us great promise for potential growth in the Tanzu portfolio over time.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Phil. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\\nMauricio Munoz -- Raymond James -- Analyst\\nThank you for taking my question. This is Mauricio in for Simon. Can you please talk about the -- some of these industry supply shortages and how could this impact in VMware sales? I'm a bit curious about -- on the potential headwind from customers that are perhaps unable to get the systems that VMware runs on. So with the understanding that you sell software, are you seeing any impact from these hardware shortages that could be limiting your sales? Thank you.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So as you note, there are chip shortages that are impacting significant portions of the economy. We have not seen -- like you point out, we are in the software business, and we have not seen it significantly impact our business so far. And a lot of the customers run our software on their existing infrastructure. And even in the cases where they're -- as well as in the cloud, and this is, in fact, one of the benefits of our solution being available across all the clouds. And then even in those cases where they're putting our software on to new hardware, they have not reported on new shortages.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Maurice. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Reback with Stifel.\\nBrad Reback -- Stifel -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks very much. Zane, I think last quarter, you talked about some of the hyperscaler-led business leading to longer rev rec. And I would assume that would be in the subscription and SaaS line. Did you see any of that this quarter?\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nHey, Brad. Yeah, this is Zane. We continue to see great growth in that area, not only on the bookings side, but now you're starting to see the traction. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, across all the hyperscalers, we're really pleased with the traction we're seeing. To your point, that does create a little bit of the delay between the bookings growth that we see and then ultimately when we see that consumption and recognize the revenue. So, I'd say, generally speaking, it's been consistent, but we're impressed with the demand we're seeing. And the interest, back to the earlier question on partnerships, that's another area where we see continued interest on partnerships and tremendous opportunity for us with our multi-cloud opportunities. So all good on that front.\\nThanks for the question, Brad.\\nBrad Reback -- Stifel -- Analyst\\nThanks.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThanks, Brad. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nSo we'll take our next question from Tyler Radke with Citi.\\nTyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst\\nHey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the Q4 guidance. It looked like on the license side, the upside didn't fully flow through. Just curious if there was any type of kind of unusual activity you saw in Q3, whether pull-forward? And then just some comments overall, what you're expecting for fiscal year-end, just with budget flush and typical Q4 activity? Thank you.\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nYeah. Sure, Tyler. It's a good question. As you point out, we increased the total guide, but we didn't obviously pull in -- take all of what we saw in Q3 into Q4. We're really pleased with our view of the second half of the year. And obviously, as you heard in our prepared remarks, as well as the commentary here, I mean, the macro is clearly supporting good growth across the Company, and we're quite encouraged with the momentum we're building across the portfolio. So, as we looked at it, we think our second half looks good. We were encouraged by our ability to execute in Q3. So there may have been a few deals that may have either landed in Q3 or Q4 that we saw in Q3, but we believe the demand is there. We're pleased with the execution across the Board and correspondingly with the guide.\\nSo I'll leave it at that, but obviously, we're encouraged by what we're seeing heading into Q4. And, obviously, with some of the high-level comments I provided for FY'23, we see that momentum continuing into the new fiscal year for us.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Tyler. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and nice quarter. I was wondering if you could go back to the Project Arctic. And can you give us any guidelines in terms of how to think about the relative pricing for some of these SDDC solutions of what you're garnering from the customer in an on-premise environment and how that changes in a cloud environment when they start making that shift toward subscription and maybe not a cloud environment, but as they start making that transition to subscription? And relatedly, is that going to have any longer-term impacts on gross margins that we should be aware of when we're kind of forecasting out a couple of years?\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So, overall, with the Project Arctic, we are still in the very early days, and we don't have any pricing nor anything of that nature to disclose because we are not shipping the product yet -- shipping the cloud service yet. In general, because this is a cloud-delivered and cloud-managed service, usually, when we deliver something from the cloud managing some piece of software on-premise, there is a management premium that we had, and I would expect that to be present. The important aspect of Arctic is it also allows us to weave in things like disaster recovery and better security and so on and so forth. And those are additional capabilities that today are priced offerings that we would be able to as part of this upsell, as part of Project Arctic. So net-net, we expect this to be a win-win solution for the customer, helping them lower their management costs, also give them capabilities that they did not have before, lower their cost of insuring security, etc. And then from a VMware perspective, it will allow us to deliver more value to these existing customers.\\nAnd then the second aspect of your question around gross margin, again, we don't have operating -- actual operating experience because Arctic is not out yet, but we expect this to be a healthy gross margin business.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Keith. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\\nQuinton Gabrielli -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\nHey, guys. This is Quinton on for Jim. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just for us, could we get an update on the team's appetite for acquisitions at this point? Are there opportunities to look at something a little bit larger, a little more transformational? Or do valuations today still push the team to more of a tech tuck-in type deal? Thank you.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So I'll start and Zane can add more. So from a VMware perspective, we've always had a fairly consistent philosophy with respect to acquisitions. By and large, the vast majority of what we do would be classified as tuck-ins or product-level acquisitions. And then occasionally, we do what we call platform level acquisitions, which we do when we enter into a new product segment, product category or expand significantly into a new adjacency. In fact, over the last, whatever, 15, 17 years of -- that we've been doing acquisitions, we have done only about four that were of that nature, over $1 billion. So I expect that pattern to continue. As you well know, we did two major acquisitions of that nature a couple of years ago, and we are still bringing them into the mainstream of our business and driving those product growth areas for us. So I expect the current pattern to continue going forward as well.\\nSo let me...\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nYeah. I would just add, as part of our capital allocation, obviously, we look at growing both organically and inorganically. And even with the debt that we've taken on and the special dividend, we believe we've got tremendous flexibility on the M&A front and continue to operate as we have in the past, as Raghu alluded to. So we're very comfortable with our positioning there.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Quin. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Brad Sills with Bank of America Securities.\\nBradley Sills -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks guys for taking the question here. I wanted to ask a question on some of the deliverables you outlined the launches at the Analyst Day for Tanzu Community Edition, Application Platform and Service Mesh Advanced Edition. I guess, in particular, there's a lot of innovation there. I guess, the Community Edition, should we think of that as a potential for driving some bottoms-up adoption here, where you see a real community develop here, open source users that you could see some upgrade activity from over time? Thank you.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah, for sure. A big goal for Tanzu Community Edition is for people that are coming new to Kubernetes, as well as developers that want to build on top of it. And in fact, over the first four to five weeks that we have had it available, we have had over 10,000 downloads. We've seen a nice community farming. And so, we are very encouraged by that, as well as the Tanzu Mission Control Starter Edition, which provides management capabilities at an entry level. So one aspect of VMware that is -- one aspect of our business that is critical when we get more and more developer and platform operator focus is product-led growth, and this would be the start of those initiatives.\\nBradley Sills -- Bank of America -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Brad. Next question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\\nBrad Zelnick -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you so much for fitting me in. My question is for Sumit. Sumit, it's now two quarters in a row where you've had more customers within EUC opt for term licenses versus subscription and SaaS. Is there something specific happening within VMware or within that particular product line that would explain for this? Or is there any reason to perhaps believe that customers are recommitting to self-managed infrastructure?\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nHi. Yeah. I think this is a little bit of a reflection of both timing, as well as choice. As with Horizon, we have given customers choice and flexibility for adopting the subscription and SaaS -- sorry, cloud products and cloud-based virtual desktops at their own timing and their own when they're ready. And they oftentimes start with term. And I think I've stated that in the past that each of these customers as we are signing them up with term-based license, they all have plans and intent to move their desktops to the cloud. And as the terms that they are signing up for come up for renewal is usually the time window when we get the opportunity to get them over to the cloud. And the window of the time when they sign up for term is just the duration it takes for them to plan moving their desktop to the cloud. So that's the best way for you to think about the business. There's really not sort of lack of intent or desire by customers to take their desktops to the cloud.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Brad.\\nBrad Zelnick -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\nThank you.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nNext question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\\nBill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\nHey, guys. This is Bill [Phonetic] on for Brent. Thanks for taking our question. Just going off the previous question, given some of the noise recently around Citrix, just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing on EUC and just in terms of win rates and if there has been any change at the margin there? Thanks.\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nYeah. I'll start and Raghu, you can add. First of all, we see tremendous interest in customers for our virtual desktop solution, and that's really the only category that we compete with Citrix. Our end user computing portfolio, first of all, is much broader than what Citrix offers. But oftentimes, customers who have had Citrix implementations and VMware's implementations for broader end user computing portfolio, not including virtual desktops. We are certainly seeing customers who, when they are looking at cloud-based desktop deployments, interest in standardizing on their broader workspace and end user computing portfolio with VMware. So we do see larger enterprises now looking at innovation from VMware and end user computing to be much stronger and more powerful. And we continue to see customers who have in the past used Citrix now looking at VMware Horizon solutions.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. Just to...\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you. Go ahead, Raghu.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nI have a couple of -- especially in this post-pandemic world that we live in, remote work has become a pretty significant part of the consideration when choosing these solutions. And we introduced an Anywhere Workspace solution that combines, obviously, the ability to run the desktops either in the data center or in the cloud, but also the ability to get network access and secure them through our SASE solutions, and of course, manage and provision applications. So it's a much more fuller solution with the cloud option that Sumit talked about. So that's very differentiated from Citrix.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nNext question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\\nKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nHi. Thank you very much. I'll add my congratulations as well. I wanted to just ask your perspective on the subscription and SaaS, and in particular, there are two important drivers strategically for the Company. One is the cloud provider partnership in particular. Wanted you to expand your comments, if you could? On AWS, what do you see in terms of the pipeline going ahead? Obviously, with re:Invent coming up the next week or so, how is that partnership with AWS progressing as far as the pipeline visibility is concerned? And also, if you could touch upon Tanzu, any big pivotal deals -- not pivotal, but pivotal Tanzu deals that are truly transformative that give you conviction that Tanzu is certainly headed strategically in the right path? Thank you so much and congrats.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So on the -- and let me start and Sumit can talk about the pipeline. So with AWS, as you know, Kash, they are our preferred partner, and we do some deep engineering collaboration with them. And we continue to do that, and we've got a number of items planned in our roadmap. Over the next months or so, that will further expand the addressable set of workloads that can be served using our joint solution. So the partnership is going very well, and the two teams have been working very well.\\nAnd before I turn it over to Sumit for the pipeline, let me briefly touch upon the Tanzu question. Yeah, we -- if you think about what we are trying to do with Tanzu, we're trying to do two sets of things. One is, we are trying to provide a modern application operations team that's in the public cloud or in the private cloud with a comprehensive set of solutions that help them manage their modern application environment, their cloud-native environment, secure them and connect them. So our products like Tanzu Service Mesh, Tanzu Observability, of course, Tanzu Mission Control, all of them put together serve as a very comprehensive portfolio. And we have seen customers buy into it. One of the key reasons they buy into it is this breadth of portfolio.\\nThe second reason they buy into it is the fact that this is available to them regardless of where their network cloud data application is running. And we have got a number of wins on Azure. We've got a number of wins on AWS. Of course, we've got wins on top of vSphere as well.\\nAnd then the second part of the portfolio is the Tanzu Application Platform, which accelerates developer productivity on the public cloud of their choice. That is still on beta, so we don't have transformative wins to announce there as yet. But we are super excited about the reception to both. Sumit?\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nKash, I'd add on -- I'll start off with cloud providers. First of all, I'm excited about the portfolio expansion that we did on the VMware Cloud front during last quarter. Certifications to expand us to target larger sort of federal customer base sort of expansion of services and sort of zones where the service is available across all hyperscalers, newer services that we have introduced on VMware Cloud on AWS such as Tanzu now integrated, as well as VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts. So tremendous opportunity and all of that leads to new use cases that we are able to serve.\\nNow, in terms of wins that give you -- a win that gives you a picture of how we are winning with cloud services, the best sort of story that I would provide is, our financial services firm where they're now looking at our cloud to provide all their loan officers, call center agents, a full sort of service that is fully automated and scaled out through our cloud environment. And now trying to do that modernization in their own infrastructure would have required them to have talent and time, neither of which were possible without our solution. And that's what we are seeing as a predominant reason why customers are looking at our cloud infrastructure across all of our -- all the cloud providers as a predominant use of going to VMware Cloud solution.\\nAnd then for Tanzu, I think Raghu already touched. For modern applications using Kubernetes across multi-cloud, we are seeing customers start with either one module or adopt our full platforms that Raghu talked about in a very, very easy-to-adopt fashion at this point of time from Tanzu.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Kash. Next question, please.\\nKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\nThank you, Raghu and Sumit. Thanks so much.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll hear next from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\\nKarl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst\\nGreat. Zane, I wouldn't mind pressing a little bit on your guide for high-single-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2023. That's impressive, a little bit higher than I was modeling. It's actually an acceleration from your exit growth rate of 7% in 4Q this year despite larger scale, despite what I'm sure are some pressures as you transition from upfront license maintenance to subscription. So I just wanted to see if you might unpack a little bit where that confidence comes from and ask two secondary questions, whether it might be more second half weighted and whether if you could confirm that it's entirely organic? Thank you.\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nSure, Karl. I'll tell you, first off, we obviously give it at a high level, so I appreciate the commentary on it. So I'm not going to get into detail on first or second half. I will tell you, as we look at next year, to your point, it is a balance of us continuing to drive that growth, not only on the product side, but the go-to-market side and the operating side of our sub and SaaS portfolio. And then in conjunction with that, continue to deliver on the license portion and the on-prem portion of the portfolio, which as you saw in the third quarter, had really strong performance. And it's a combination of that -- our message resonating in the marketplace, the confidence our sales teams, and as you've heard here across the portfolio that we have -- with the products we have, and in particular, the multi-cloud message that's resonating with our customers and the momentum we're seeing for the year.\\nI mentioned sort of the second half. And then, obviously, heading into FY'23, we're confident that we can continue to see that growth on the mix between the on-prem and then continue to drive the sub and SaaS growth at an ARR that we believe will be stronger than the ARR we expect to see this year for all the reasons that Raghu mentioned. When we breakout each element of that portfolio and we look at the bookings performance and the pipeline performance that we're already seeing, a lot of the deals that Sumit's team are negotiating right now will be recognized as revenue into the new year. So a lot of that gives us the backdrop to the outlook that we believe we'll execute against for the next fiscal year, and obviously, more to come on our next call. But thanks for the question.\\nKarl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst\\nOkay. Thank you, Zane.\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nThanks.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Karl. We have time for one more question. So this would be the last question, please.\\nOperator\\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman with BMO.\\nKeith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nThank you very much. Good evening. Raghu, I wanted to see if I could direct this to you. In the past management, VMware management has talked about 80% of apps are running on the cloud -- running on-premise, 20% on cloud and over time that would invert. And I wanted to try to get a feedback on some of that growth is transitioning existing applications to the cloud, but a lot of it is the growth of new applications. And I want to hear your characterization of VMware's attach rates, ARR contribution and/or growth rates of new applications versus existing applications. What does that look like in terms of your ability to win for the new applications today in particular? And how would you think about that changing over the next year or two as Tanzu begins to -- or not begins to, but continues to mature?\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. So as I've spoken about in the Financial Analyst Meeting, we are in an age of explosive growth with respect to applications. And we see applications growing, obviously, in the public cloud, in the data centers and private clouds and increasingly at the edge as well. I think by some industry analyst estimates, two out of three applications -- new applications are in the public cloud are a little higher, depending on which analysts you believe in. So for the applications that are going into the data center, given our preponderance in the data center and private cloud, they tend to invariably land on top of our platform -- the applications on top of our infrastructure platform. And then as we build out our Tanzu portfolio, they start to use Tanzu as well. Similarly, as applications go into the edge, we've got a pretty significant presence at the edge, and those applications tend to land on our platform as well.\\nThe applications on the public cloud, clearly, there's a large set of those applications landing on the Cloud Providers infrastructure. But as Tanzu gains more maturity and as we introduce new capabilities like Tanzu Application Platform, etc., we are seeing customers start to use that as well to make the task of building new applications on public clouds easier.\\nAnd then last, but not the least, with the VMware Cloud offerings on the public Cloud Providers, we are starting to see new applications land there as well because we just recently handed -- added Kubernetes capability to the VMware Cloud offerings. So as we build those out, we expect to see getting a good share of new applications on the public cloud as well. So on the whole, if you look at public cloud, data center, edge, we are well positioned to capture a good chunk of the new applications.\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nThank you, Keith. Before we conclude, Raghu, I think you had a concluding comment to make.\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nAbsolutely. Thanks, Paul. So thanks for the Q&A, and thanks for spending the hour with us. What I wanted to say in summary, VMware is committed to providing an ubiquitous software platform for our customers as they navigate to the multi-cloud and distributed era. We have a fantastic team, and we have a great portfolio that serves our critical customer requirements. And last but not the least, especially post-spin, we have a strong and growing ecosystem. So we are really well positioned to succeed.\\nThanks for joining us today, and have a great Thanksgiving.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\\nDuration: 61 minutes\\nCall participants:\\nPaul Ziots -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\nRaghu Raghuram -- Chief Executive Officer\\nZane Rowe -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\\nSumit Dhawan -- President\\nMatthew Hedberg -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\\nMark Murphy -- J.P.

[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast. Please go ahead.\\nRob Quast -- Director of Investor Relations\\nThank you, Sarah. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's second-quarter 2021 earnings call. I am excited to be here today and look forward to working with all of you in my new role as head of investor relations.\\nI am joined today by Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer, Rodney McMullen; and chief financial officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.\\nThe Kroger co. assumes no obligation to update that information. Our press release and supplemental information regarding the quarter can be found on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions.\\nI will now turn the call over to Rodney. \\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Rob and congratulations on your new role. I would also like to take a minute to thank Rebekah Manis for her service to the IR team. We wish her continued success in her new role as head of new geographies for our customer fulfillment centers. Finally, I would like to thank you all for joining us today.\\nOur associates have done an incredible job operating our stores, pharmacies, supply chain and manufacturing facilities through the COVID environment. Their unending commitment to serving our customers and communities continues to make a difference in Kroger's second-quarter identical sales without fuel grew 14% on a two year stacked basis, ahead of our internal expectations. We saw triple digit growth in digital over the same time period and continue to drive costs out of the business through cost saving initiatives and operational efficiencies. We remain confident in our positioning and our ability to deliver consistently attractive total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time.\\nI'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing three key areas. First, customer behavior and how our seamless ecosystem is working. Second, I'll share examples of how we are leading with fresh and accelerating with digital and finally, I will highlight how we continue to live our purpose to feed the human spirit through the associate experience and our work to advance Kroger's ESG commitments. Our strategic focus on leading with fresh and accelerating with digital continues to build momentum across our businesses.\\nAs we've operated through the pandemic, we've recognized the structural shifts in our customers' eating and cooking habits. Customers are responding favorably to our value proposition and are enjoying the convenience of our seamless offerings. Early in the quarter, customers visited stores more frequently and many shifted from online to in store. This highlights the relevance and convenience of our easily accessible footprint.\\nTowards the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 cases increased in many geographies, customers began shifting back to our digital solutions. This further demonstrates the strength of our seamless ecosystem. Customers can choose how they want to shop. Our job is to be available in every channel, so the customer does not have to compromise.\\nRegardless of how they choose to shop, customers are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options. While some food and home trends may be transitory, our research suggests those I highlighted are structural and Kroger is uniquely positioned to address them. Through our assortment of fresh products, world-class digital platform and innovative meal solutions, we will continue to elevate our position as a food authority so that when customers think food, they think Kroger. We continue to advance our position as a leader in fresh during the second quarter.\\nWe saw positive identical sales in produce and floral and deli bakery, even as we lapped elevated sales in 2020. Our research shows how much our customers love our brands. Sales for both simple truth and private selection brands were strong as food-at-home trends remained sticky. We continue to innovate within fresh.\\nFor example, our expanded partnerships with ghost kitchens allow us to offer customers freshly prepared, on-demand restaurant food. This is especially relevant at a time when many customers are looking for inspiration and 70% of our customers say convenience is important when cooking. We also announced our 2021 Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator cohort and are already bringing innovative, locally and regionally sourced products to stores across the country and helping many small entrepreneurs achieve their dreams. Earlier this week, Kroger announced our new brand icon.\\nThe fresh cart icon brings together the Kroger Family of Companies under one unifying visual and reinforces our brand promise, fresh for everyone. We are very proud of our growth in digital, which increased 114% over the last two years, similar to our first-quarter growth. We remain on track to deliver against our 2023 digital growth and profitability targets introduced at our 2021 IR Day. While digital sales decreased 13% during the quarter, almost all customers who reduced their online spend during the quarter continue to shop with us in store, highlighting the power of our ecosystem and our ability to create a meaningful customer experience across all channels.\\nAs a short reminder, Kroger has doubled our e-commerce household penetration, increasing the number of our brick-and-mortar customers that engage with our digital solutions since 2019. During the quarter, we added over 340,000 new customers to our digital platforms. We continue to expand capacity across our footprint and we reduced wait times for Kroger pickup. As we look ahead, our seamless ecosystem will remain a competitive advantage as we offer what customers need and want in a way that fits into their life, whether it's shopping in our stores, picking it up at our stores, or getting it delivered or shipped directly to their homes.\\nWe continue to enhance our seamless ecosystem. As we've shared last quarter, we currently have two customer fulfillment centers open, which are expanding our capabilities in Ohio and allowing us to expand into the new geographies within Florida. We are happy with the performance thus far and are energized by the volume and growth in both sheds. In Ohio, our focus has been on evolving the customer proposition to maximize opportunities alongside our existing digital solutions.\\nIn Florida, we launched delivery savings pass, offering customers unlimited deliveries for just $79 per year. We continue to see incredible Net Promoter Scores and our customers tell us they love our friendly, professionally trained drivers and the refrigerated delivery vans that bring the freshest food directly to their doorsteps. Looking ahead, we remain on track to open six customer fulfillment centers over 2022 and 2023, which will further expand our seamless ecosystem. Before I share some specifics on how we are using data and personalization to grow the business, I thought it would be helpful to remind you about our rewards program and how it works.\\nOur rewards program has been active for over two decades. It captures data from 60 million households and 96% of our sales. Customers clearly see the value of our program, which drives sales and builds loyalty. As an example, nearly 60% of all items in a digital basket were added through our personalization science, highlighting our ability to make meaningful suggestions that surprise and delight customers.\\nFurthermore, when we personalize recommendations for our customers, we can reduce their time to shop by nearly 70%. Overall, one in three people have noted that groceries have gotten more expensive in the past months. Kroger customers benefit from our personalization as we offer highly relevant savings at a household level, allowing them to further stretch their food dollars. Our associates continue to deliver a full, fresh and friendly customer experience every day, every time while also supporting our communities through the pandemic.\\nWe remain urgently focused on keeping people safe in our stores and facilities. Our teams were recently recognized with the gold award for excellence in human capital management from the Brandon Hall Group for our people-centered COVID-19 response. Obviously, we're especially proud of that recognition. During the quarter, we introduced new technology to elevate our associate experience.\\nKroger launched Fresh Start, a new, personalized training program to foster greater associate engagement and retention. We also launched our FEED app, which provides associates easy access to company communications and resources from their smartphones. We are incredibly proud that, during the quarter, we saw an improvement in retention as we strive to gain an employer where associates can come for a job and stay for a career. Now, turning now to the live our purpose.\\nWe continue to believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, where to work and where to invest in companies that are taking meaningful steps to improve our communities and work to build a more sustainable planet. We've recently published our 2021 ESG report on thekrogerco.com. It outlines our progress over the last several years. It further outlines our aspiration to further integrate ESG performance into lines of business and our commitment to creating shared value that benefits all stakeholders.\\nWe imagine a world where everyone is thriving together and Kroger is helping millions of people live healthier, more sustainable lifestyles, protecting and restoring natural resources and contributing to more responsible and inclusive global systems. One of the many ways we bring our ESG vision to life is through our work that our Kroger Health team has been doing to serve and support our customers and communities through the pandemic. During the quarter, we worked with Lyft to provide rides to COVID-19 vaccine appointments, teamed up with local sports icon to drive awareness and access in the underserved communities and we concluded our #communityimmunity giveaway. To date, we have provided over 6.7 million doses of the vaccine and continue to drive availability and education.\\nAnd yesterday, president Biden noted that Kroger is one of three national partners who have agreed to make the rapid COVID test available to customers at cost for the next 100 days. Kroger is committed to helping people live healthier lives while safeguarding the communities we serve. Our ESG goals are ambitious. And with a team of almost 500,000 dedicated and driven associates, they are also achievable.\\nSince we first introduced our commitment to delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return in 2019, our teams have been laser-focused on execution. This focus has resulted in tangible results, allowing us to deliver this quarter and for the long term. Now, I would like to turn it over to Gary to discuss our second-quarter financial results. Gary?\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks, Rodney and good morning, everyone. Kroger is delivering strong results and continues to build momentum as we execute on our priorities of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. During the quarter, adjusted FIFO operating profit grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 23% over 2019 and adjusted EPS grew by a compounded annual growth rate of 35% over the same two year period. This reflects our disciplined approach to executing our strategy, balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and accelerating growth in our alternative profit business.\\nIt also provides a further proof point of how we are successfully navigating the pandemic and emerging stronger as a business. I will now provide additional details on our second-quarter results. Identical sales without fuel declined 0.6%. On a two year stack basis, identical sales without fuel increased 14%.\\nEach period during the quarter was stronger than the last and I'm delighted to say we returned to positive identical sales without fuel during the final period of the quarter. Our digital platform remains a key strength in our model and we were pleased with the triple digit growth achieved over 2019. We remain on track with our plans to double our digital business by 2023 and would expect continued investments in the customer experience, scaling of new fulfillment centers and several new innovations which we will announce throughout the year to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, we would not expect future digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle COVID in 2021.\\nDuring the quarter, we also made further progress in improving digital profitability as we achieved a record low for the time taken to pick a digital order in store and continue to see growth in the media revenue generated on digital transactions. Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel, decreased 60 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily related to price investments and higher shrink and supply chain costs, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in our alternative profit business.\\nOn a two year basis, our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel, decreased 55 basis points compared to 2019. Consistent with many retailers, we experienced supply chain constraints and increased warehouse and transportation costs during the quarter. We are actively managing this risk within our business by securing increased capacity and augmenting associate retention programs within our own facilities. We expect supply chain costs to remain elevated in the second half of the year and this is contemplated in our updated guidance.\\nIn the second half of the quarter, we also saw higher inflation in some categories. We are being disciplined in working with suppliers to manage these increases and are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. While difficult to predict with precision, as we shared last quarter, we believe inflation for the full year will be higher than originally contemplated in our 2021 business plan. For the second half of 2021, our guidance now assumes inflation of between 2% and 3%.\\nRecognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $47 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. Further strong operational execution allowed us to leverage operating, general and administrative expenses by 76 basis points excluding fuel and adjustment items, in the second quarter. This reflects lower COVID-19-related costs and savings captured through our cost saving initiatives. On a two year basis, our OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased by 137 basis points compared to 2019.\\nWe continue to see opportunities to streamline processes and leverage technology and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings during 2021. The traffic and data generated by our seamless ecosystem continues to create a strong flywheel effect for our alternative profit business, which again experienced significant profit growth in the quarter. Media and Kroger personal finance continued to lead the way and we remain on track to achieve the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers.\\nGallons grew in the second quarter by 7% and outpaced market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.13 this quarter versus $2.14 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.39 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020 and fuel was a tailwind to operating profit of $33 million compared to prior year. Turning now to our financial strategy.\\nWe continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to investing in the business to drive sustainable growth while also returning excess cash to shareholders. We are prioritizing capital investments that support our growth strategy, widen our competitive moats and deliver strong returns. Capital expenditures year-to-date were down compared to prior year as we carefully navigated the impact of higher project costs and longer project lead times due to a challenging labor market. As we confirmed in guidance today, we are maintaining our range for capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, of between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion and would currently anticipate coming in at the low end of this range for the year.\\nDuring the quarter, Kroger repurchased $349 million of shares and year-to-date has repurchased $751 million of shares. As of the end of the second quarter, $779 million remains outstanding under the current board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. In June, Kroger also increased the dividend by 17%, marking the 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our proactive approach to investing in our associates over recent years is helping us navigate a challenging labor market.\\nOur strategy continues to focus on investing in compensation plans that reward our associates in ways that are meaningful to them. We are committing to investing $350 million in hourly wage increases for our associates during 2021, in addition to the $800 million we invested in associate wages between 2018 and 2020. Over the same period, we have also taken several opportunities to improve the security of our associates' pension benefits. Our average hourly rate is now in excess of $16 an hour.\\nAnd with comprehensive benefits factored in, we'll be approaching $21 by the end of 2021. We are committed to increasing retail hourly wages sustainably and our long-term financial model fully contemplates continued investments in associate hourly rates. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Atlanta, Michigan, Food 4 Less and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 34,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Portland.\\nOur financial results continue to be pressured by inefficiencies in healthcare and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Turning now to our expectations for the second half of 2021. Driven by momentum in our results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full-year guidance.\\nWe have also narrowed the range of our guidance as we are further into the year and the trends in our business and the broader food-at-home market become clearer. We now expect identical sales without fuel in the second half of 2021 to be flat to slightly positive, resulting in full-year results of negative 1.5% to negative 1% and a two year identical sales stack of between 12.6% to 13.1%. We expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.35. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion, reflecting a two year compounded annual growth rate of between 14.1% and 15.6%.\\nIn conclusion, we are emerging stronger through the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% by sustainably growing earnings and using our resilient free cash flow to return excess cash to investors. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Gary. The environment we operate in is dynamic and I am so proud of our associates' ability to meet the challenge and serve our customers while building for the future. Kroger's seamless ecosystem is working. This was evident during the quarter as we saw customers seamlessly shift between channels and we continue to see strong digital engagement.\\nWe are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to deliver against the total shareholder return model we introduced in 2019 and reaffirmed in 2021. Kroger will continue to deliver for all stakeholders and position the business for long-term success. Now, we look forward to your questions.\\nQuestions & Answers:\\nOperator\\n[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\\nSpencer Hanus -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning. This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. Can you guys talk about the comps that you're seeing quarter to date? Because I think the guidance does imply somewhat of a slowdown on a two year basis in the second half. And then although it's early, how are you thinking about comps in 2022.\\nDo you guys get back to your long-term algo next year? Thanks.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. As Gary mentioned in his prepared remarks, the last period of the second quarter, we returned to positive identicals. And so far, in the third quarter, we continue to see the trend of positive identicals and our guidance for the balance of the year is positive as well. So we're very pleased with where we are.\\nWe're pleased with the performance our teams are doing and we're making progress and substantially ahead of where we initially we thought we would be at this point in time on cycling the COVID peak from last year. As we look toward 2022, Gary, unless you want to get into more of the details, I think the key thing would be what we talked about at our investor day in 2021 and that's our commitment to a TSR model of 8% to 11%. And that's driven by a combination of sales growth, slight margin improvements and taking free cash flow and returning it to our shareholders via dividend and stock buyback. And the sum of those together is what will drive the 8% to 11% and we remain committed to that.\\nAnd obviously, since we put it in place in 2019, we've outperformed it. I don't know, Gary, if you want to add anything.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThe only thing I would add, I think you said it very well, Rodney, is we feel really good about the trends in the business, obviously, as we shared on the prepared comments. As you look at the back half of the year, you asked some -- for additional color on how we're thinking about the trends that we're seeing there and the guidance, I would say we're obviously heading into the back half of the year, as Rodney mentioned, with momentum in the business. We did raise the guidance to now be in that sort of 0% to 1% for the back half of the year based on reversing into that from the year-to-date performance and the guidance that we gave for the year. Overall, we're feeling really good about how we're executing in the business and seeing that sustained trend in food at home as consumers continue to gravitate toward some of the trends that Rodney talked about.\\nAnd also, obviously, we are seeing some return to previous behavior with the Delta variant currently prevalent in the U.S. as well. That being said, we do still think there are some knowns in the market. If you look at different countries, how long the impact of the Delta variant lasts, if you like, on consumer behavior, we are seeing some consumers return to normal behavior, returning to offices in some cases.\\nAnd so while we feel really good about our trends and our ability to continue to win with the customer, the back half of the year would be more of an 11% to 12% two year stack based on still some of the uncertainties and unknowns around those elements that we're still looking to see how they play out. I think the only other thing that I would reinforce on Rodney's comment is that we do expect, as we shared at our investor day at the beginning of the year, that as we come through 2020 and 2021, we expect the overall food-at-home trends in the market but also specifically Kroger's overall sales to come out of 2021 in a much stronger position than we would have been had the pandemic not occurred. And so we believe that, that will still certainly be true as we head toward '22. And obviously, we look forward to sharing more details on 2022 when we get toward the end of the year.\\nSpencer Hanus -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nThanks. That's really helpful color. And then could you guys comment on how rational your peers have been at passing through inflation? And are you expecting any gross margin headwinds from some of the elevated inflation in the perimeter of the store? Any additional color there would be helpful.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nIf you look at, during the quarter, about half of the gross margin impact was from higher shrink and higher supply chain costs and Gary, in his prepared remarks, talked a little bit about both of those. But if you look at shrink, a lot of that, about half of the half or 25% of it is driven within the shrink component and that's heavily driven by organized crime or at least it appears to be. And I know Congress and other groups are starting to spend more time on understanding what's driving that and what's behind it and what's the distribution channels for the stolen products as well and trying to manage that. And then on the supply chain costs, we are proactively investing there to minimize the effect.\\nOn both of those areas, the guidance that Gary shared for the balance of the year reflects the pressure in those areas. And from an inflationary standpoint, as you know, over time, we've been successful in operating in slow or negative inflation and high inflation and we would see this no different. And our business, the easiest place to operate is when inflation is between 3% or 4%, but you don't ever get what you -- it makes it the easiest. But so far, we're -- costs are being passed through in an organized way for the most part and as we would expect and following our strategy.\\nSpencer Hanus -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you so much.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Greg. Sorry.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I wanted to drill down into your comments around the consumer embracing eating at home, coupled with targeting the total shareholder return formula for next year. We're still largely in the midst of this pandemic.\\nMany workers are still working from home. So is the strength this year just delaying the inevitable shift back to food away from home in calendar '22? And if that's the case, you're guiding to a 3% operating margin this year essentially. So how will you be able to maintain this operating margin rate in an environment where your sales are going to continue to be pressured, particularly as you have reduced a lot of your OG&A expenses this year?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Michael. I'll start and let Gary finish. If you look at all of our research on people eating at home, customers are telling us, they enjoy eating at home and eating with their families, which we believe is structural and sustainable. They're also telling us that eating at home, they're able to eat healthier, stretch their budget significantly further because it's not nearly as expensive as eating in a restaurant.\\nAnd they also like showing off their new skills on cooking. And all of those things, everything that our research would suggest are long-term trends and structural trends. The other thing that everybody on the call, your guess is as good as ours. But everything that we can tell, we believe that people will continue working from home more than the past.\\nAnd many companies and I know certainly we are, are supporting people in terms of different jobs, what jobs can be worked from what location. And in all of those cases, what we're finding is people are eating more meals at home, i.e., breakfast and lunch. So everything that we can see, a meaningful part of the trend change is really structural and sustainable and it's not just a onetime blip because of COVID. In terms of the margins and stuff Gary I'll let you drill into some of that detail.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. I think all I would add Rodney is maybe just -- Mike, we'll take you back to the journey we've been on for the last three years with our model. And if you think about how we teed it up at our investor days, we feel that over 2019, 2020 and now 2021, we're really demonstrating how we're able to manage the business more holistically as we think about delivering on our TSR model. So you think about the continued investments, even through the pandemic, that we are making in our customers to ensure that they see the value we're delivering, whether that's in the experience and some of the digital investments or through continuing to invest in price where it make sense and personalization to make sure positioned well with the customer, the investments that we're making in average hourly for our associates to ensure that we're continuing to improve the experience there.\\nAnd as you look at that and then think about the way in which we've managed costs, we're continuing to accelerate our alternative profit businesses and at the same time, continue to get stronger and more effective at sourcing and managing margins in that way. I think that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to manage the business overall and drive a strong TSR in line with our commitments as you think about over time what our commitments are to our shareholders. So we'll obviously get into more specifics around how we think about '22 later in the year. And at this point, I wouldn't want to get into specific details about next year, but that's certainly how we think about our model and how we get confident in our ability to maintain the trajectory over time and supported by Rodney's comment on how we think about continuing to see the customer spend dollars on food at home and how we can continue to grow our business within that context.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. As you look at cost, it's one of those things where we've been able to take cost out of the business without affecting the customer experience for years. And I know when we set out a goal, we always think that that's all we're going to find and then our great teams are able to find more areas for process change and cost opportunities. And when I watch our operations team, Gary mentioned the procurement team, our technology team, but more importantly, how our stores and technology and operations team are working as one, they continue to identify things to make our associates' job easier to reduce the number of touches of product and be able to take costs out, which our customers then benefit.\\nAnd some of that cost reduction is shared with our customers. Some of it is shared with our associates, but it's part of the overall flywheel that continues to accelerate and make our model sustainable. And Gary's point on alternative profit is an important component of that as well.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nActually, Rodney one other thing on the cost side Michael that I think is important too. We've mentioned this again at our investor day, but this -- the plan that we have to double digital profitability, that's obviously very important to the long-term strategy that Rodney outlined around how do we make sure that, from a customer perspective, they're not having to compromise between store and digital experiences but is also important from a business model point of view to continue to improve the profitability of the channel. So that from our perspective, we can be agnostic from whether the customer is buying online or buying in the store. As we grow that digital profitability rate, important to remember that just doesn't affect the growth in the future, it affects the $10 billion business that we have today.\\nSo that's also proving to be a tailwind in the financial modeling OG&A now but also will continue to be a tailwind because we're only partway through that journey as we take cost out of filling an order and continue to grow media revenue per transaction as well.\\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\\nAnd my follow-up is focusing on the media revenue per transaction, it seems like that's the area where you're really supporting the profitability of your digital business and subsequently, the overall gross margin for Kroger as a result. Where are you from an advertising perspective from a large CPG company perspective versus getting more advertisers on the platform? Can you frame out how big this advertising opportunity can be? And as an unrelated side note, to what extent was there a vaccine distribution benefit within the gross margin? One of your large competitors talked about that within the quarter.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, several questions there. I'll briefly talk about the media. We still see retail media as a significant opportunity. And we shared at investor day, but Kroger's retail media team and our retail media offer in five different areas, we ranked No.\\n1 among our competitors in three of the five and we were tied for No. 1 on the other 2. So obviously, the value CPGs get from our offer and our ability to use our data to make sure the right customers are seeing offers is substantial and significant and we believe that it's a significant opportunity to continue to grow retail media. I won't get into specifics, other than we would say that we feel like we're just getting started.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nAnd then, Michael, I would just say on the health and wellness question, we would certainly have seen some benefit from COVID vaccines during the quarter. Having said that, we pivoted a lot of our efforts in the pharmacy business, which, as you know, is a big part of our operation and our little clinics. So I would say, net-net, if you look at the health and wellness business, I would think of it as largely being on plan. And so I wouldn't think of it as a headwind or a tailwind during the quarter or, for that matter, being a headwind for the rest of the year either.\\nI think we've got fully contemplated within our guidance the expectations around the health and wellness business going forward.\\nMichael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst\\nThank you very much and good luck.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\\nChuck Cerankosky -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst\\nGood morning, everyone. Nice quarter. I want to talk a little bit about or ask a little bit about private label in this inflationary period. How do you see customers reacting to it? And is there a difference between a customer shopping in store and online?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. If you look at our brands, simple truth and private selection continues to really gain share and grow. We're also finding big packs are growing significantly. If you look at -- for us, we find our brands -- if CPGs are passing through inflation that's not real, all -- every time when somebody does that, our brands even gain incremental share.\\nThe other thing that I've been really proud of our team is the innovation behind the product and we've introduced over 140 new products in the quarter and would continue to expect that going forward. I don't -- we're not seeing behavior changes. If you go back to prior times when you had inflation, the customer, a lot of times, would trade over to our brands as part of their -- structuring their budget. We're not seeing budget changes on our brands happening at this point but I'm sure if inflation continued.\\nOur customers are telling us they still feel pretty good where they are financially. And for the most part, people are still saving at record levels and things like that. Now at some point, if budgets got more constrained, you'd probably start seeing some of that behavior. But the business we're gaining right now is really being created because of the innovation in our product and the quality of the product and it's really standing on its own.\\nChuck Cerankosky -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst\\nAnd then secondly Rodney, are you seeing regional differences in the shifts in the way people moved in and out of e-commerce over the course of the quarter?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes, we would. And it's really wherever COVID is higher, you would see the shift to more online and that's delivery and pickup. And as it moves north, you would see that within the company. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the things that we're especially proud of is almost every customer that were shopping with us digitally early in the quarter that started -- that stopped shopping digitally, they started shopping in the stores.\\nAnd for us, that's really important as part of our overall strategy for seamless because what we find is, after the first year, an online shopper actually comes into the store more often than they did before they became an online shopper.\\nChuck Cerankosky -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst\\nAnd have you quantified what your total e-commerce did to the operating earnings during the quarter? Is there any way to put a number on that, whether a smaller loss or is it trending toward a positive number?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nWell, I'll let Gary -- I'll talk a little bit. If you look at within the quarter, obviously, we had the start-up costs of our sheds in Florida and Monroe. So that created a headwind. Obviously, that was reflected in our guidance that we gave for the year and our updated guidance.\\nI don't know, Gary, if there's any additional.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nWell, I think we talked about, Chuck, the profitability of digital in different ways. When we add in all the fixed costs, we're more on the journey toward profitability, as you are alluding to. We generally focus, though, on what's the pass-through rate on the transactions as we're growing customers because what we find with digital, as you know, is the customer becomes more loyal overall to Kroger and we see about 50% or so incrementality as the customer engages digitally. As we've talked about previously, we've kind of -- when you think back to last year, we're at mid-single-digit pass-through rate compared to a pass-through rate that will be closer to mid- to high teens on a store transaction.\\nAnd we're on the path to improving that profitability to drive toward doubling the profit rate on the digital transaction and ultimately targeting to get to parity. I would say we're making good progress on that journey. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we continue to make solid improvements in the efficiency of picking a digital order. And over time, we'd expect Ocado to play a role in that as well, of course, with the automation they provide.\\nAnd with media revenue continuing to grow rapidly, that's also creating a tailwind. So I'd say we're seeing good momentum and on track with where we expected to be with that journey in the quarter.\\nChuck Cerankosky -- Northcoast Research -- Analyst\\nThank you very much. Good luck on the rest of the year.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you, Chuck.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\\nEdward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nYeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about share repo and the cash balance.\\nSo you ended the quarter with a lot of cash. Again, you're well below your leverage target. Thoughts on the buyback. Is the stock attractive here, I guess, is a straightforward question? And what are your thoughts on taking out additional debt to buy back stock? Because with the dry powder that's there, I mean, it seems like you could probably take out north of 10% of the shares.\\nIs this a bigger part of delivering 8% to 11% next year? Just kind of curious as to how we should be thinking about all this.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Ed. I would say, overall, we're not changing our overall financial strategy. As we think about our free cash flow, we continue to start with how can we invest in the business to grow it profitably and sustain growth and we still think there's lots of opportunity to accelerate the model.\\nAs we -- I think we alluded to a little bit of this at our last investor day, our goal over time would be to be stretching our top line growth and our overall earnings growth, so the focus for excess free cash flow is certainly looking for where the opportunities as we believe we can continue to lead with fresh and accelerate with digital to drive that growth. We're certainly going to look at any of those incremental investments against the bar of saying, is that going to drive a stronger return for investors versus buying back incremental stock? But within our overall framework today, as we obviously continue to invest in the business to grow, we are committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders at the level that we've shared in our current TSR model. As you've heard us say, we increased the dividend by 17% to reflect really our confidence that we expect to come out of COVID at a higher position from an operating profit perspective as we leave 2021. And and we continued to buy back stock during the quarter and would expect to continue to buy back stock at the current price.\\nWe do leverage a grid. I think I've referred to this before. So think about it as depending on where the share price is. That -- if the share price is lower, it buys back more stock during the quarter.\\nIf the share price is higher, it buys back less stock because we're not trying to time anything in the market. We're already trying to make sure that we're maximizing the return on the dollars as we go through the year to take advantage of fluctuations in the prices as it happens during a difficult trading period. But we certainly remain committed to returning cash to investors. We start with the excess cash from a point of view of saying where could we accelerate our growth.\\nAnd ultimately, we'll share more on that as we identify those opportunities. And we'll continue to flex, if we believe that there aren't those opportunities then obviously, we'll look to make sure we are dynamic in making sure we're deploying excess cash.\\nEdward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nOK. Great. And just a quick follow-up on the gross margin. Is the two year number for Q2, is that a good way to think about the back half or with inflation accelerating and supply chain, does that headwind grow a little bit in the back half? Just curious as to how we should be thinking about that.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes. I think actually, Q2 is a pretty good sort of overall -- I'm going to -- again, we don't get into specific numbers. But I think, directionally, it's a helpful way to think about the back half of the year. As you think about overall earnings, we would think gross margin continued to be a headwind, part of that being warehouse and transportation, part of it being shrink.\\nWe're also continuing to invest in the business where we think it makes sense and give value to customers. OG&A will continue to be a tailwind, but we will see less COVID cycling, if you like, in the back half of the year. So that's why the overall impact on operating profit won't be as strong in the back half of the year. But I -- if you think about Q2 in general outside of that cycling of extra COVID costs last year in the first half of the year I think is a pretty good way to think about the back half of the half of the year, Ed.\\nEdward Kelly -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThanks, Ed.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\\nMichael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thank you for taking the questions. I was just hoping to get a little bit of incremental color around the ID sales. Has the transaction count turned positive at this point? And then secondly, if you could provide some incremental color around how much inflation you were able to kind of pass through to consumers vis-\\u00e0-vis what you saw in COGS, just because at times, in the past, you have given some helpful context there?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. If you look at transaction count, we would continue to have a slightly declining or kind of flat transaction count. It really depends on if you're looking at versus prior year or two years. If you look at basket size per purchase, it's significantly increased in terms of when customers come into the store, they buy significantly more; or if you look at our online shop customer, that customer's basket size is significantly higher than a basket when somebody comes into a store.\\nSo both from a digital standpoint and individual transaction standpoint, customers are significantly buying more. And it's all -- it's really three things. One, they're buying more. They're also buying premiumization of product where they've upgraded the products they buy and they also are buying bigger-sized products as well.\\nSo if you think about toilet paper, very few customers now can or will even buy a four pack of toilet paper, where most customers now are buying 24 pack or even bigger in some cases. In terms of the inflation, Gary, I'll let you answer Michael's question on that.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nThanks for the question, Michael. Yes, we've laid out before, I know, on the call, we have a very robust process for how we manage when we see inflationary costs flowing through from suppliers. And first of all, we challenge to make sure that we feel confident they're legitimate because, obviously, we want to make sure that they truly are structural cost changes. And then if they are, we absolutely have a process for passing them on to the customer.\\nI would say that, generally, we've been very comfortable with our ability to pass on the increases that we've seen at this point and we would expect that to continue to be the case looking into the back half of the year. As you saw during the quarter, we are, though, continuing to invest in price where we think it makes sense. Sometimes that might be in areas where we're seeing inflation. Sometimes it might be we're investing because we believe it's the right thing to do to grow customer long-term loyalty in other places through our personalization strategies.\\nSo overall, we feel good about the way in which we're able to manage the inflation within the business. At the same time, we are continuing to invest because we believe that's going to be important to grow share over the long term as well.\\nMichael Montani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\nGot it. Thank you.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nKaren, are you there?\\nKaren Short -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\\nOh, sorry. can You hear me now?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYes.\\nKaren Short -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\\nSorry about that. Yes. So I had a couple of questions just related to guidance. Gary, you mentioned that the vaccine admin fee kind of netted out with respect to other initiatives that you had in, I guess, health and wellness in general.\\nI'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on that because it was very sizable and one of your competitors in terms of basis point contribution to gross margin. And then other model questions that I just wanted to clarify were what your actual LIFO expectations are for the year because that's obviously relevant for EPS and then what your COVID costs were in the quarter and what your expectations for COVID costs will be for the rest of the year. And then I had one other bigger-picture question.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nSure. Thanks, Karen. On the pharmacy side of things, yes, so essentially, as you know, we operate little clinics as well in a number of our stores and multiple of our stores have little clinic facilities. And in our pharmacy core business, we continue to support the COVID vaccines.\\nSo my comment earlier was, when you look at the total health and wellness business, as we pivoted resources to do more COVID vaccinations and as we provided that support, whether it be through off-site locations or through our own facilities and you look at the total impact of the pharmacy business as customers shifted to more COVID vaccines and less of the newer prescriptions, if you like, even though we grew script count overall during the quarter and continue to grow script count. If I look at the total impact on the health and wellness business for the quarter and the year-to-date, there wouldn't be a material overall outside of business plan performance. Although certainly, if you look to the COVID vaccines in isolation, they would have created an incremental value to the health and wellness business, but it was offset by lower revenue or lower margin impact on other parts of that business, so netted out to being on plan, if you like. And as we look at the back half of the year, I wouldn't expect it to be a reason that we have an incremental headwind in margin because of having less COVID vaccinations in the back half of the year as things start to return.\\nSo certainly, we expect some vaccines in the back half of the year, but things start to return a little bit more to normal and less of a spike in vaccines compared to what we saw in the first half of the year. From a LIFO perspective, as you -- I think you probably know, it's not really an easy thing to predict because LIFO was a charge, is one data point at the end of the year. As we looked at the data point so far this year, we're seeing an inflation. We use those spots to predict where it would be.\\nI think the best guidance we could give you is if you take the year-to-date performance in LIFO that we've charged to the P&L and then gross that up effectively for the full year, that would be essentially our full-year expectation based on the data points that we've seen to this point in the year in our outlook. But FIFO -- I'm sorry, LIFO, I beg your pardon, is notoriously difficult to predict, so we're giving you our best estimate. But at the end of the day, it will be driven by accounting rules and a data point toward the end of the year. But I think the best indication we can give you at this point is to use the year-to-date performance and gross that up for the year is our best estimate.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nIn essence, annualized. And so divided by seven times.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nExactly, exactly. Yes.\\nKaren Short -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\\nRight. And then just COVID?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nCosts for the quarter.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nYeah. So as I mentioned earlier, we certainly saw significantly greater costs in the first half of last year. As a company, we adapted and learned how to operate more efficiently. We would certainly see continued COVID costs in the back half of this year but cycling less costs from last year.\\nWe would expect it to be south of $100 million a quarter. But certainly, we're still seeing incremental costs. And some of the areas that you would probably expect when you think about how we're continuing to operate through COVID, we still have masks costs during the quarter. We still have cleaning costs.\\nWe still have extended leave of absence for any associates that are identified as having the COVID virus -- been diagnosed as a positive COVID case. So those would be the kind of costs that we would see and we'd expect it to be a little bit less than $100 million a year -- sorry, a quarter, I beg your pardon, as we look at the back half of the year and still being a slight tailwind year over year but nothing like what we have seen in the first half of 2020.\\nKaren Short -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\\nOK. And then just my bigger-picture question is on Florida, so with respect to Ocado. Curious, Rodney, on your early learnings from Florida and whether you think that you may want to emphasize opening sheds in markets where you actually don't have physical retail locations. Or any thoughts on where you're at on that philosophy in terms of markets where you have high market share, markets where you have middle market share or markets where you have no presence based on what you know so far?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYeah. It's a great question, but we're still early in the process of answering that. And if you look in Florida, we are tracking ahead of where we thought we would be at this point. And the thing that I'm especially proud of our teams in Florida is our Net Promoter Scores are incredibly strong.\\nI mean, mind-boggling strong and made up in the neighborhood of best-in-class across all industries. And as you know, food retail usually struggles with having Net Promoter Scores that are up in the Apple neighborhood and things like that. So I'm incredibly proud of what our teams are doing in terms of creating the experience for the customer. And I appreciate and like your question.\\nI would say we're still early in the process and we continue to learn every day on our ability to ramp up a facility in a new market. Certainly, it's easier communicating to the customer in new markets or markets where our share isn't as high. And that was one of the reasons why we picked Florida and picked Monroe here outside of Cincinnati was to learn how to integrate it within our existing infrastructure and then having something from the ground up. And I would expect, over time, we'll learn how to do both of them and we'll be really happy with the results.\\nKaren Short -- Barclays Investment Bank -- Analyst\\nGreat. Thanks very much. That's helpful.\\nOperator\\nYour last question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\\nRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. -- Analyst\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question and fitting me in. So I guess just going back to the gross margin headwinds during the quarter that you saw. Today, you called out shrink in supply chain.\\nIt sounds like that may be half the pressure that you saw during the quarter. I was curious if you see those headwinds on the shrink and supply chain at all transitory.\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nI think incrementally, yes. But if you look at shrink, I think shrink will remain higher. Now we will go through and do all kinds of process changes to try to minimize shrink, but we are being more aggressive. And Christine Wheatley, who's our General Counsel, is also working with some trade associations to try to start working on it in a broader group, not just Kroger-specific when you look at organized crime.\\nAnd I know I was reading Home Depot's earnings call and they talked about the same thing. So we do believe that will be important to partner with the government and the way products are able to be sold in the marketplace. So I do think there's things we will do to improve, but some of it will be a headwind until we're able to address that. On supply chain, I think an awful lot of that will be transitory, but you still have to manage through it.\\nRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. -- Analyst\\nOK. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. We're hearing more and more from suppliers lately of challenges in the supply chain and being able to fulfill all the consumer demand out there.\\nSo I was just curious how your out of stocks right now trending versus what you've seen in recent months?\\nRodney McMullen -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\\nYes. I would say that we're slightly higher. Now our teams had, going in, been continuing to aggressively forward buy inventory. Originally, it was because of the inflation pressures.\\nIt's ended up because of some of the supply chain issues. It's also one of the benefits of a lot of our own brands and we manufacture a lot of our own brands. So our plants are aggressively pushing capacity. So I would say that it is a headwind.\\nIt's slightly worse than it was, but we continue to work on minimizing and maximizing the in-stocks.\\u00a0\\nRupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. -- Analyst\\nOK. Great. Thank you.\\nGary Millerchip -- Chief Financial Officer\\nBefore we conclude today's call, I'd like to take a moment to remember the tragic event that took place nearly 20 years ago tomorrow and to honor the lives lost on September 11, 2001. And as always, I'd like to take a moment to address our associates who are listening in. Thank you for delivering an outstanding performance this quarter and continuing to support our communities through the pandemic. As the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant, I want to affirm that health and safety of our associates and customers remain our top priority.\\nWe are doing everything we can do to make sure the vaccine is accessible and available to you and our customers wherever they are. I am so proud of our Kroger Health team who have already administrated 6.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Thank you to our talented healthcare professionals for being there for our communities and for addressing questions for our customers about the vaccine and about getting the vaccine. I'm often reminded of the impact our associates have on the lives of our customers.\\nRecently, one of our pharmacy managers in Atlanta saved a life of a customer that was having an allergic reaction in one of our stores. This is just one of the many examples that in extraordinary ways our associates care for those around them. Thank you for inspiring me every day and thank you for all you do every day to be there for our customers, our communities and each other.
